Yugoslavia was an (EDIT: not an eastern bloc) country made up of the following republics: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia (including the regions of Kosovo and Vojvodina) and Slovenia.

Those countries have a population of about 23 million people, making it smaller than Texas (28 million).

Pound for pound I don't think there's any region that produces more high level NBA players. This national team would be nasty. A bit thin on the wing, but when you have Doncic at PG and Jokic at C you've got plenty of size.

>The main negotiator in the Knicks-Jazz talks on New York’s side was Gersson Rosas, who was let go by the Timberwolves for his part in a reportedly dysfunctional front office that included his relationship with a team employee. Rosas was hired as a consultant by the Knicks in February but took control of the Mitchell talks because of his relationship with Jazz general manager Justin Zanik.

> Ainge was not the front man in the Mitchell talks. The perception that he has taken over the organization and decided to run the club in the same style as the rebuilding Celtics from a decade ago — acquiring first-round picks and trading quality veterans — isn’t necessarily accurate.

I think i've found the one he was talking about. [Here's the box score](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/198011010PHI.html).  

Bird had 36/21/4 and Dr J had 45/9/4 in a OT game. 

The problem is, I can't find any highlights of this game. I can't find it at all on Youtube and i've checked some other shadier sites and I can't find it either. I can't even find any newspaper clippings except for just 1 that has a box score.

48,2022-09-05 20:51:53,Which team would win the 2023 NBA Championship if the league reverted to the 13 Original Rules of Basketball by Dr. James Naismith?,"The 13 Original Rules of Basketball are:

1. The ball may be thrown in any direction with one or both hands.
2. The ball may be batted in any direction with one or both hands (never with the fist).
3. A player cannot run with the ball. The player must throw it from the spot on which he catches it, allowance to be made for a man who catches the ball when running at a good speed if he tries to stop.
4. The ball must be held in or between the hands; the arms or body must not be used for holding it.
5. No shouldering, holding, pushing, tripping, or striking in any way the person of an opponent shall be allowed; the first infringement of this rule by any player shall count as a foul, the second shall disqualify him until the next goal is made, or, if there was evident intent to injure the person, for the whole of the game, no substitute allowed.
6. A foul is striking at the ball with the fist, violation of Rules 3, 4, and such as described in Rule 5.
7. If either side makes three consecutive fouls, it shall count a goal for the opponents (consecutive means without the opponents in the mean time making a foul).
8. A goal shall be made when the ball is thrown or batted from the grounds into the basket and stays there, providing those defending the goal do not touch or disturb the goal. If the ball rests on the edges, and the opponent moves the basket, it shall count as a goal.
9. When the ball goes out of bounds, it shall be thrown into the field of play by the person first touching it. In case of a dispute, the umpire shall throw it straight into the field. The thrower-in is allowed five seconds; if he holds it longer, it shall go to the opponent. If any side persists in delaying the game, the umpire shall call a foul on that side.
10. The umpire shall be judge of the men and shall note the fouls and notify the referee when three consecutive fouls have been made. He shall have power to disqualify men according to Rule 5.
11. The referee shall be judge of the ball and shall decide when the ball is in play, in bounds, to which side it belongs, and shall keep the time. He shall decide when a goal has been made, and keep account of the goals with any other duties that are usually performed by a referee.
12. The time shall be two 15-minute halves, with five minutes' rest between.
13. The side making the most goals in that time shall be declared the winner. In case of a draw, the game may, by agreement of the captains, be continued until another goal is made.

73,2022-09-05 22:30:30,[Serious] The Simple Analytics of a 4pt Shot if Implemented,"Ok, The three point revolution kinda started when the analytics personnel realized that you just need to be a 33.33% Three Point Shooter to match up the efficiency of a 50% Midrange- Inside Shooter. 

If we add a 4pt line, what should be the percentage of 4pt shooters to be efficient? It is actually just 25%!!!

**For Ex**

6/12 (2pt FG) - 50% = 12 pts

4/12 (3pt FG) - 33.33% = 12 pts

3/12 (4pt FG) - 25% = 12 pts

-----
So yeah 25% is the magic number to be efficient at a 4pt shot. 

Now, the question is where will be the 4pt line drawn? If the distance between the FT Line and 3pt line, is the same as distance between 3pt line and 4pt line. 

I think NBA Players Can easily adapt to be a 25% 4pt shooter in that area. (Do you think so too? Or Am I overestimating the Capabilities of NBA Shooters?)

I think we will not have a 4 pt line for the next 10 years at least.  But I do believe it will be implemented maybe 20-30 yrs from now. 
Or who knows, maybe the league just waiting for Steph to Retire. (Just like how Blocks and Steals are invented when Wilt retired)

If ever, Where should be the 4pt arc be placed? 

PS:

The only thing I wouldn't like if this happens. Is that it will be a new game again. And the players records cannot be measured with each other anymore. Like for ex. A player in the future has more pts than Steph. The current gen will argue, it is just because that player has the benefit of a 4 pt shot!!! Or something like that. Haha.

I wanted to begin with the story of one of the most popular players to play in the modern NBA. This is a story that intersects basketball, a young phenom, systemic racism and a town's own reckoning with its divisions.

If you wanna read through his story before you learn his name, just skip past all spoiler tags.

### The player is >!Allen Iverson!<...

## Backstory

This player (nicknamed Bubba Chuck) was born in Hampton, Virginia in 1975 to Ann, a single mom aged 15 years.

Now, Hampton was a small town that possessed a pretty sizable black population (around 40% back then) - although still quite siloed off from the white population. Not a lot that was noteworthy about the place, aside from things like being the hometown of Mary Jackson (one of the 3 'computers' who featured in [*Hidden Figures*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Figures)).

He had a rough upbringing since his family was poor and many of his friends were arrested multiple times (including the time when his father figure was arrested in front of him for drug dealing).

All through this, the one thing he had going: sports. And *daamn* was he good at it...

---
## The greatest athlete Hampton had seen...

In a town ruled by high school sports, he was the absolute champ and likely the best athlete the town had ever seen.

In 1992, he led his high school team (the Bethel High School Bruins) to winning the Division 5 state football championship. He did this as the star quarterback & defensive back for the team.

The Daily Press named him its football player of the year with this blurb:

> "">!Iverson!< the quarterback passed for 1,423 yards with 14 touchdowns. >!Iverson!< the runner gained 781 yards with 15 touchdowns. >!Iverson!< the kick returner scored five touchdowns, four on punts. >!Iverson!< the defensive back intercepted eight passes.""


Shortly after he won the state football championship, he made a bold prediction that his school would win the state championship in basketball too. Three months later, he did, with him averaging a record 31.6ppg.

The Associated Press named him the Group AAA player of the year in both sports. Parade Magazine named him the *best* high school basketball player in the country and top-10 football player in the *country.* And here's the Daily Press about his basketball:

> *""Maybe the nation's best high school point guard, the first team Parade All-American led the Bruins to their first state, Eastern Region and Peninsula District titles. He is at the top of the list when players having the complete package of skills are discussed. He has explosive quickness, great leaping ability and NBA 3-point shooting range.""*

And all this as just a ***junior!***

---

## *Valentine's Day 1993*

On V-Day 1993, he has hanging out with a bunch of his friends (all black, including him) at a local bowling alley. The facts are that his group was quite raucous and had to be quietened down a couple of times. And there was another group of white kids bowling, some of whom were drinking.

What happened next is unclear... Some accounts claim that the white guys called him an unspeakable <banned expletive> and his friends by some unsavory terms and then started throwing punches. Other accounts claim that his friends went up to the white kids and taunted them first.

In any case, a brawl broke out between the white youths and the black youths, and the fight was racial. Fists, chairs and slurs flew freely until the brawl was finally broken up by onlookers.

Overall no one was grievously injured although two people were unconscious. A third group of white kids had gotten caught up in the cross-fire and ended up getting injured too - one of whom was a 23-year old college kid who had been struck by a chair & ended up needing six stitches near her eye.

....

The cops finally came in and as expected, made a beeline for the black kids. Many of the black kids ran once the police arrived, while the white kids (now bruised and battered) stayed back to chat with the cops and gave their statements.* 

**Four people were arrested for this brawl: all black, including Bubba Chuck. No white kids were arrested.**

---

## The American legal system...

Of the incident, he said:
> ""*For me to be in a bowling alley where everybody in the whole place know who I am and be crackin' people upside the head with chairs and think nothin' gonna happen? That's crazy! And what kind of a man would I be to hit a girl in the head with a damn chair? I rather have 'em say I hit a man with a chair, not no damn woman.""*

Given the racial nature of the case, the location of the case (a divided town with an almost equal white & black populations), and the fact that a young white woman was injured, the prosecutors threw the book at Bubba Chuck and his friends. 

**American Legal system, Exhibit 1:** Since there was no clear victim and there was no clear perpetrator, Bubba and his friends were charged with an archaic Civil War-era statute called 'maiming by mob', a law that hadn't been used since the 1800s. The original statute was introduced to provide a means to charge everyone who was part of a mob that was involved in lynching black people.

The statute just required proof of presence at the site of violence and not explicit proof of participation in the violence. (the idea being: if you were part of a mob lynching a black person, everyone who was present is responsible and not just the people who did the actual assaulting...)

**Exhibit 2:** Since he was 17 years old at the time of arrest, his probation officer strongly recommended that he be tried as a juvenile. Such recommendations are almost always followed, but juvenile court judge Louis Lerner overruled and sent the case to circuit court. Now, despite being 17, Bubba was being charged as an adult due to the 'seriousness of his crime'.

And he was predictably convicted.

**Exhibit 3:** The sentencing was done by the presiding circuit court judge (notoriously conservative piece-of-shit Judge Nelson Overton) - and the judge sentenced him to a whopping *fifteen years* in prison on three felony counts.

### Yes, FIFTEEEN YEARS in prison.

The same judge had given lesser sentences to literal killers and heinous criminals, but had a reputation of being overly harsh to black defendants. 

**Exhibit 4:** To top things off, the judge denied all bail requests pending appeals - even though in Virginia all but the most violent criminals are routinely granted bail. Hell, the prosecutors were willing to set bail at $15,000, but were overruled by the judge.

Similar crimes usually attracted only community service, which really underscored how fucked up the prosecution, community and judges were in this racially divided case. 

----

## Before the Hamptons Five there was the Hampton Four...


Some of the media attention about his arrest was predictable - with white families writing op-eds about his ""troubled past"" (despite him having no record aside from a traffic violation), ""broken household"", and all the usual hits. Others argued that the mere utterance of the <banned expletive> should not provoke black teens into getting into a fight, and that they needed better parenting. The entire town of Hampton was divided over his arrest.

Small protests broke out and many groups organized to plead for the innocence of Bubba and his three friends, now dubbed the ""*Hampton Four*"". 

Civil rights groups were involved, local churches were involved and there was a growing mass of people pushing for justice. You could see graffiti on buildings that read '*JUSTICE FOR BUBBACHUCK*'. Members of the Bethel High football team refused to talk to reporters, and some black leaders were contemplating an economic boycott against local merchants and the media.

And gradually it gained wider and wider attention: drawing in national media like USA Today, Washington Post and  Tom Brokaw. Spike Lee wrote to Bubba Chuck in prison. The SCLC got involved, the NAACP got involved. This case was gaining eyeballs.

Bubba still ended up serving four months in prison before being granted clemency by Douglas Wilder, the state's governor. And a year later, his case was eventually tossed by the Virginia Court of Appeals citing insufficient evidence.

## The aftermath

After his prison sentence, he could not go back to Bethel High School and instead went to a local school for at-risk students. College offers dried up for him but Georgetown University's coach John Thompson offered him a scholarship, which he accepted. 

In two years at Georgetown, he was twice named Big East DPOY, and twice set the single-season steals record, and led his team to the regional finals of the NCAA tournament.

### And in 1996, Allen Iverson was picked as the first overall pick by the Philadelphia 76ers...

130,2022-09-04 10:05:18,Everyone for Luthiana came to play today...except Sabonis.,"What a great game. Despite the loss, everyone on the Lithuanian team gave left it all out on the court, especially Jonas Valcunas who was pretty much the only reason that game went to 2 overtimes.

With that being said, Sabonis in this FIBA tournament, including this game, has been so bad that there's basically no signs of his NBA All-Star level play.

The team has played better with him on the bench than it has with him on the court. Even when Jonas was on the bench and he was the sole center on the court their play was a major downgrade from when Jonas was the sole centre on the court and he was on the bench. And this is not true for just defense. Its for both ends of the ball. 

The prime example of it was in OT of this game when for may god know what reasons the Luthiana coach decided to sit JV at around the 2:15 mark of OT and inserted in Sabonis. The first that happened after that was Germany getting a wide open dunk at the rim as Sabonis was not to be seen anywhere near the basket. 

Even though it was just a 3 point game before this play, Luthiana had all the momentum and were rolling towards what seemed like an easy victory in OT with most of Germany, especially their big men in foul trouble.

But instead of taking advantage of the opportunity and bouncing back from his bad play, Sabonis disappointed yet again and eventually fouled out with around 40 seconds left in OT before doing anything of significance.",True,128,0.85,66,/r/nba/comments/x5p5b5/everyone_for_luthiana_came_to_play_todayexcept/,Saransh69

203,2022-09-05 15:20:44,where does Donovan Mitchell rank?,"In the aftermath of the Donovan Mitchell trade, Zach Lowe speculated that Mitchell is somewhere between the 18th and 24th best player. At first blush that seemed a bit conservative to me, so I decided to start naming players who people would say are better than Donovan Mitchell until it got to the nebulous gray area. 

The no brainers: 9 names

Lebron, Curry, Durant, Giannis, Luka, Embiid, Jokic, Kawhi, Tatum

Solidly  better:

AD,  Butler, Lillard, Harden, Ja

That's 14.

The rest I think, to me anyways, are arguable but I am guessing people think are better since they've made all NBA 

PG, KAT, Booker, Paul, Kyrie

That's 19 above him.

So that leaves names like Jaylon Brown, Bam Adebayo, Kris Middleton, Jrue Holiday, Zion Williamson, Brandon Ingram, and Klay Thompson.

What makes this hard is how much weight do you put on Mitchell having the most valuable skill in the NBA, a high volume relatively efficient bucket getter? Because that skill in high leverage moments would seemingly put him above a lot of names?

210,2022-09-04 11:20:09,Another 2023 standings prediction,"Now that we've probably seen all the major trades and signings (aside from some players like Schröder), we know what the league will look like in 2023. Instead of giving teams' records, I will tier them based on how many wins I think they will get. So, strictly for regular season performance. I assume healthy rosters.

#East

#### 55-60 wins

* 1) **Philadelphia 76ers**: I believe in the Harden resurgence. 
* 2) **Boston Celtics**: I expect them to carry their stellar play in the second-half of last season to this one.

####50-55 wins

* 3) **Cleveland Cavaliers**: Last year's Cavs could've pushed 50 if not for injuries. Add Mitchell and they are serious threats.
* 4) **Milwaukee Bucks**: They will be good. But some of their core players are pushing it in age, so I don't expect them to dominate.
* 5) **Brooklyn Nets**: The concern is chemistry, not talent. By talent alone they would be in the 55-60 wins tier.
* 6) **Miami Heat**: I have them falling from 1st less due to regression and more due to expecting other teams to be better.

####45-50 wins

* 7) **Atlanta Hawks**: Dejounte is a great addition, though not enough to vault them out of the play-in in a stacked east.

####40-45 wins

* 8) **Chicago Bulls**: Should be better as a team than last year if their players stay healthy, though the record may not say so due to the stacked east.
* 9) **Toronto Raptors**: See above.

####35-40 wins

* 10) **Washington Wizards**: If Beal and KP stay healthy, this team can potentially claim a playoff spot from the play-in. I wouldn't count on it, though.

####30-35 wins

* 11) **New York Knicks**: They could have made the play-in if they landed Mitchell. As is, I don't see it considering the teams above them. They will be tanking by April.
* 12) **Charlotte Hornets**: Let's see what happens to Bridges. For now, I assume he won't play for them again, in which case the Hornets should probably just mail it in and tank this year.

####25-30 wins

* 13) **Orlando Magic**: Fully healthy, they have a high-potential team. Will Isaac finally play? Regardless, they should just let the young guys show out and compete next year.
* 14) **Detroit Pistons**: They need more pieces/development around Cade before they can think about making the play-in.

####20-25 wins

* 15) **Indiana Pacers**: Victor.

#West

####55-60 wins

* 1) **Golden State Warriors**: They would have won 60 last year if not for injuries. They could exceed 60 if we see development from Wiseman and Kuminga.

####50-55 wins

Probably will win games on the lower end of this range, maybe into the upper 40s, because there are so many teams here. They have to lose to someone.

* 2) **Dallas Mavericks**: The Mavs won at a 62-win pace after the end of December. Replace Brunson with Wood, Powell with McGee, and add in THJ.
* 3) **Minnesota Timberwolves**: Gobert is the yin to KAT's yang. The Wolves have the makings of a top regular season team.
* 4) **Los Angeles Clippers**: Talent-wise they belong with GSW, but they will focus on load management over the #1 seed.
* 5) **Denver Nuggets**: Add in Murray and MPJ and their depth improvements, and the Nuggets will look much better than last season.
* 6) **New Orleans Pelicans**: The Pelicans are on their way up. Add in a 27 PPG/65 TS% player to BI/CJ/JV and they are a solid playoff team.
* 7) **Phoenix Suns**: Remember, this is a tiering, so I could see the Suns finishing much higher. But given CP37's possible regression, I don't give them the benefit of the doubt.

####45-50 wins

* 8) **Memphis Grizzlies**: They would be on the above tier if not for JJJ's injury.

####40-45 wins

* No teams here. The west is too stacked.

####35-40 wins

* 9) **Los Angeles Lakers**: Let's see if they trade Westbrook, but for now, their depth is mediocre. LeBron and AD are enough to keep them in the play-in if healthy
* 10) **Portland Trail Blazers**: Good enough to make the play-in, but a long shot to make the top 8 considering the teams above them.

####30-35 wins

* 11) **Sacramento Kings**: Keegan Murray looks good. The Kings will be focused on the Victor race by mid-March.

####25-30 wins

* No teams here. Any half-decent front offices will avoid this zone.

####20-25 wins

The Victor zone.

* 13) **Oklahoma City Thunder**: With Chet, they could make a tier above. But without him, they are locked into another year of tanking. I don't think they mind.
* 13) **Utah Jazz**: As it stands, they aren't bad enough to land in this zone. But I expect Clarkson, Conley, and Bojan to be gone by the All-Star break if not New Year's Day.
* 14) **Houston Rockets**: Still tanking. Not a problem for them; let the young guys develop.

####15-20 wins

* 15) **San Antonio Spurs**: They suck.",True,10,0.66,18,/r/nba/comments/x5qx9q/another_2023_standings_prediction/,BayonettaBasher

A lot of rebuilding teams have some vets that have been kept for that mentoring-rookies role, that I would love to see on contenders. Players like Terrence Ross, Eric Gordon, Nerlens Noel, and Alec Burks.

There are also a few players that are core parts of teams that should probably start to tank for Wembanyama. Players like Kelly Oubre/Gordon Hayward/Terry Rozier in Charlotte, or maybe Jakob Poeltl in San Antonio. And of course, we still await the Utah firesale, hopefully before the season begins. (Bogdanovoc, Clarkson, Markkanen, Beasley, Conley, Gay)

If the Lakers do decide to see how Westbrook performs in the front half of the season before possibly making a move at the deadline, Hield and Turner could still be options from Indi, or Knicks/Jazz packages possibly?

Jaw Crowder could easily become that starting 4 for Miami. Coby White, I believe, has more potential than being the 4th string PG in Chicago. 

Any other players you’d like to see moved by the deadline? Any other thoughts on teams’ structures thus far?",True,10,0.86,20,/r/nba/comments/x5nsh7/what_players_do_you_expect_to_be_traded_beforeat/,KorgG29

241,2022-09-03 23:03:53,What's the deal with NBA shorts? Who decides when and what's considered before the shorts change?,"I think this is the place to ask. I've seen the posts in this subreddit time to time and, all together, I'm confident some of you maintain vast quantities of fascinating, useless knowledge on the weirdest niche sports shit.

This is a topic I've always wondered about but never asked. Never found myself in a situation where it didn't seem like a fucking weird question to ask the people I was with, and if they wouldn't think that, who the fuck cares? I get it. 

Having an admittedly pedestrian and passive interest in the NBA since the whole Pacers/Pistons brawl back in ['Nam,](https://i.imgur.com/G2eWTY6.jpg) I take notice every few years and see noticable changes every time.

I have noticed the length of shorts get [shorter](https://i.imgur.com/62WNV4K.jpg) since then. 

But has there ever been secret drama or any debacles around shorts-length changes?

Why were shorts so long at one point in the last 25 years? 

Are there modern trends the NBA tries keep up with - or is it the fashion trendsetter?

Would the NBA ever go back to mega short shorts?

If, in a silly hypothetical world, a decision to change to much shorter shorts were to be made, what do you all think the players' reactions would be? You have to have some level of vanity if not for the sake of knowing you're not just a player but a media figure - would you postulate some players refusing to wear mega short shorts because they might think they'll look silly?

I personally would be afraid of showing how mega white my thighs are and fucking up the light and brightness correction tools on the broadcast cameras. You would see me coming a mile away just from the reflection of the court lights bouncing off my sun-starved legs. And I'd be like, ""I whiffed that game-winning dunk so bad, guaranteed no one's holding back on those leg memes now.""

But the players in those old black and white videos of basketball had shorts so short I wouldn't be surprised if a few players hung brain accidentally after a vigorous jostling of the nutsack.",True,29,0.78,32,/r/nba/comments/x5dfeh/whats_the_deal_with_nba_shorts_who_decides_when/,Beretta_M9A3

273,2022-09-03 22:25:13,Why have Hassan Whiteside and Demarcus Cousins not been signed?,"While both players are considered well past their prime, to many teams, these solid veteran role-players would appear to be solid pickups. Teams looking to make a play-off push would benefit well from a good backup center, which these 2 showed themselves to be.

In the 2021-2022 Season (per game):

&#x200B;

>Demarcus Cousins (13.9 mps) - 8.9 pts, 5.5 reb, 0.4 blks, 45.6% fg  
>  
>Cousins in games w/ >20 minutes played - 19.0 pts, 8.5 reb, 1.2 blks, 55.6% fg

&#x200B;

>Hassan Whiteside (17.9mps) - 8.2 pts, 7.6 reb, 1.6 blks, 65.2% fg  
>  
>Whiteside in games w/ >20 minutes played - 10.9 pts, 11.1 reb, 2.0 blks, 65.3% fg

&#x200B;

While these two have proven themselves to be capable nba players certainly, there is valid concerns for their health. Centers aged over 30 are not typically associated with good health, especially these two. However they did not miss many games the previous season; and among teams currently vying a playoff seat, there are many without legitimate backup centers. For a 10th man role, playing limited minutes, on playoff teams is there reason to say it is not better than nothing?",True,9,0.6,68,/r/nba/comments/x5coyx/why_have_hassan_whiteside_and_demarcus_cousins/,McMing333

276,2022-09-03 01:02:35,The True Loser of this Offseason,"In all this Donovan Mitchell - Rudy Gobert Madness and stuff and even the Dejounte Trade, I believe the true loser has been Charlotte and Lamelo Ball.

Last Year Anthony Edwards, Darius Garland, Lamelo Ball and Dejounte Murray had pretty similar seasons. 3 of them became first time all stars while Ant had an amazing Playoff Series.

But the Talent Gap in all 4 teams now seems honestly ridiculous compared to Charlotte.

Hawks - Trae / Collins / Dejounte / Hunter / Capela

Cleveland - Garland / Mitchell / Levert or Okoro / Mobley / Allen

Minnesota - KAT / Rudy / Dlo / Ant / Kyle Anderson or Jaden Mcdaniels

Hornets - Lamelo / Rozier / Hayward / PJ Washington / Plumlee

Hawks have improved a Team that was in the ECF just a season ago, cleaning up some of their Defensive Liability with Dejounte. Cleveland has put out a team with 3 current All stars & Future DPOY calibre player. Minnesota improved a team that pushed Memphis all the way and mostly lost on Margins. Also has 3 current or former All stars with another in Ant who'll surely be one soon.

All the while Charlotte loses its No. 2 to Lamelo because he's a dumbass Abuser, and The only other Quality All star Talent Hayward can't be trusted for even 50 games a season rn. Oh and they still don't give him a proper Center. Charlotte better hope Mark Williams is a stud or they're gonna kill Lamelo's Career.",True,390,0.92,131,/r/nba/comments/x4n3y9/the_true_loser_of_this_offseason/,swapan_99

Booker will become a free agent after the 2027-28 season which even if he stays until then he’s still leaving. I feel like he will be traded sometime in the next 2 years. Deandre Ayton obviously isn’t a superstar but I think he will leave as well if the suns will be in rebuild mode. In fact, here’s the perfect trade between the Suns and Twolves 

Suns recieve: Dlo, Jaden McDaniels, 2027 2rp , 2024 frp, 2029 frp 

Timberwolves received: Devin Booker

Dlo becomes a free agent after 22-23 but I think he might sign a 2 year deal and if he doesn’t this deal could go down early, the value of the 1 pick will stay the same as Dlo gets older.

If this deal doesn’t get done by 2029, then I’m going to be mad because I want this to happen so bad. Dlo looks good in a Suns jersey 


I think by the time this deal is done, Suns are a play-in team (Cp3 retired) and Timberwolves are a borderline contending team. Booker alongside maybe prime ant and older Kat-Gobert. 

PG Whatever pg they sign/signed
SG Booker
SF Ant
PF Kat
C Gobert


Trade for Ayton:
This trade will only be done if someone bad happened to the Grizzlies and they are in real need of a center to contend, because I think Grizzlies will be contenders

Suns recieve: Xavier Tillman, Yves Pons, Brandon Clarke, 2 frp

These are my top 5 candidates to get traded next off season. ( the list is in no particular order)

1. Kevin Durant. He already asked to be traded once and Kyrie's contract runs out next year. If the Nets and him dont get to an agreement and he walks, I expect the Nets to accept their fate and move KD.
2. Joel Embiid. The Sixers have emptied their treasure chest of assets and they still look like a potential second round exit team. If Harden isnt improved next year and they dont show any progression making at least the ECF, I can see Embiid deciding to ask for a trade. This would lead to Harden moving as well and the Sixers retooling around Maxey.
3. Jaylen Brown. His contract runs out in 2024 and he will not sign an extension as he is not max contract extension eligible. If Brown wants to be his own guy and Boston feels like he won't re-sign there, they will trade him so they dont lose him for nothing.
4. Zach Lavine. The Bulls are going nowhere imo and Zach got his supertmax money so he might be looking to compete for a chip. I know the KD trade proved that you dont have to trade a star on a long contract but I feel like the Bulls might be okay with this. They'll get a haul for him and can rebuild properly. This would lead to Demar getting traded as well.
5. Butler (or Bam). This is kinda off left field but if Miami isnt good next year and Bam doesn't show progress on offense I can see them trying to move one of them ( probably Butler ) and retool around the other. I dont see them trading both and bottom out as Heat Culture isnt about the life.",True,0,0.26,30,/r/nba/comments/x5zu8w/my_top_5_candidates_for_stars_who_will_be_traded/,Powerful_Bottle_8592

If you’re Chuck, your answer is The Answer. If you’re Dominique Wilkens, its Dominique Wilkens. Max wants Iguodala. The Kings are picking Bagley or trading the pick for Divac.

My problem with these drafts is they don’t start with the most important question, *What are we drafting these players FOR?*

In my opinion, there are two scenario’s we need to prepare for when making our selection.

# Objective Criteria

**Scenario 1:** We’re drafting this player for their entire career, similar to a lottery pick. In this case we’d need to select for-

a)  Sustained greatness (Not just longevity, but extended elite performance)

b)  Team success (Playoff wins against elite teams)

c)  Loyalty (Player to Franchise and fans to Player)

**Scenario 2:** We’re drafting the player for a set amount of time, similar to playing a quick game in 2k. In this case we’re selecting for-

a)  Single game performance against other star players

b)  Single game performance in a winner-take-all scenario

c)  Max Performance in the clutch

We now need to set objective criteria for each metric.

**Scenario 1a- Sustained Greatness**

Metric: Combined All-NBA and All-Defense first team selections

Reasoning: MVPs capture peaks, but are often narrative focus, and rely heavily on team success. All-Star selections are influenced by the player’s popularity. All-NBA selections by themselves focus heavily on the offensive end of the floor. By combining All-NBA and All-Defense First team selections, we reveal the players that year over year we’re the top 1-2 players at their position on both the offense and defense.

**Scenario 1b- Team Success (Playoff wins against elite teams)**

Metric: Championships/Conference Titles/Playoff Berths and 50+ win teams defeated while selected to an All-NBA First or Second team.

Reasoning: It doesn’t matter how great you are if it doesn’t lead to team success. We focus on players All-NBA years to eliminate players who found success without themselves as an active contributor- such as players winning as a low-minute rookie or well past their prime. This allows us to answer the question, *Which players had the most playoff success while a Top 10-15 Player in the NBA?*

**Scenario 1c- Loyalty**

Metric: All-Star selections for one franchise

Reasoning: This metric also shows sustained greatness over a career, however it weighs loyalty heavier than pure All-NBA career selections. It shows both the players loyalty to his franchise, and the fanbases loyalty to their player, which is arguably more important to franchise ownership.

**Scenario 2a- Single Game Against other star players**

Metric: All Star Game Performances: Wins and MVPs

Reasoning: The All-Star game is the one time we get to test how a player performs against the other stars in the league. By counting MVPs, we see which player shines against other stars. By measuring Wins, we can see which player performances lead to the most team success.

**Scenario 2b- Single game performance in a winner-take-all scenario.**

Metric: Highest percentage of team’s points scored in a win. Greatest individual performance through 3 quarters.

Reasoning: In a 2k type scenario, we’re picking the player for one game against the best teams of all time (80s Lakers, 90’s bulls, 10s Warriors, etc.) We need to select the player that has the greatest peak performance over a single game. While most points in a single game is a good metric, it doesn’t account for the different paces of play we’ve seen over the years. By instead focusing on highest percentage of team’s points, we are able to see the greatest single game performance adjusted for any era.

Additionally, In truly great performances, the other team is blown out through three quarters, and the star is rested in the 4th. To account for these historical types of performances, we will also look for the greatest individual performance in the first ¾ of a game.

**Scenario 2c- Max Performance in the clutch**

Metric: Most game-winners ever recorded

Reasoning: Time running down, fate of the universe on the line, who do you want taking the shot? Simple- the player that’s made the most game-winners in the past. There are many ways to manipulate the “game winner” metric to get the result you want. We will keep it simple, focusing on shots with 24 seconds left in 4th quarter or overtime to take the lead and win the game. As game winners we're not always recorded, this will not be an ""all time"" stat but instead a ""most ever recorded"" stat.

Now that we have selected objective criteria for our #1 draft pick, or GOAT, let’s see which players rise to the top.

# Player Comparison

**Metric 1: Combined All NBA 1st** **Tm and All Defense 1st** **Tm Selections**

Rankings:

5th: Duncan (16)

6th: Russell (11); Magic (11); Curry (11)

**In the discussion**

**Bill Russell** remains the championship king, going 8/8 in his All-NBA years. However, he only defeated 11x 50 win teams as an All NBA player, and enjoyed most of his success with only 8-10 teams in the NBA.

**Michael Jordan** we know went 6/6, is 2nd on the list of 50 win teams defeated, and is 1st on the list of 60 win teams defeated. He had a much shorter playoff timespan than the others in the discussion, with only 11 playoff berths as an All-NBA player.

**LeBron James** comes in 1st in both Conference Titles and Playoff Berths as an All-NBA player. While he did play in a weaker conference a majority of his career, he still racked up 18 wins against 50 win teams, and is the only All-NBA player in league history to defeat a 70 win team. He has the least amount of championships of the players in the discussion with 4.

**Winner**

**Kobe Bryant** is the only player Top 3 in Championships, Conference Titles, and Playoff Berths as an All-NBA player. He also dominates the 50 win teams defeated list with 24, 5 more than any other player in an All-NBA season. This gives Kobe Bryant the win in this round.

# Discussion and TLDR

Before starting this analysis, I would have been surprised if a player came in first in more than one of our 6 metrics. Instead, we see that Kobe Bryant came in first in all 6 of our metrics. This is an astonishing accomplishment, as all 6 of our metrics were chosen objectively and without any prior knowledge of how any individual player would stack up.

**Kobe Bryant is the GOAT for sustained greatness**, winning the most combined 1st Team All-NBA and 1st Team All-Defense Selections.

**Kobe is the GOAT for team success**, as the only player top 3 in playoff berths, conference titles, and championships while an All-NBA player, and the runaway leader in 50 win teams defeated while an All-NBA player.

**Kobe is the Loyalty GOAT** to and from the fans, winning the most All-Star selections from a single franchise by a longshot.

**Kobe is the GOAG**, with the Greatest of all Games, scoring 81 points and the highest percentage of a team’s points in league history.

**Kobe is the GOA3/4**, with the Greatest of all ¾ of a game, scoring 62 against the Western Conference Champion Mavericks and the only player to outscore a team through three quarters.

**Kobe Bryant is the most clutch player in history**, as the all time leader in game winners with 29.

Unlike other nephews on here that lead their GOAT debate with their hearts and not their minds, by putting fact over feelings we we’re able to together discover the truth that’s been in front of us the entire time. **Kobe Bryant is objectively and undoubtedly the Greatest of all Time.**

Due to the incredible performance of Kobe Bryant in this **objective, unbiased analysis**, I’ve decided to choose a Lakers flair post hoc and curate my post history to look like a Lakers homer. Thank you for reading.

314,2022-09-03 14:44:39,Who would make the team for the Pittsburgh Prisoners?,"As a fan of soccer/football, in our culture (this might just be an English football culture thing) we have this hypothetical team called Prison FC which is made up of the best possible squad of players (sometimes just active players, sometimes including retired players) with criminal convictions. When a player, let’s say X, gets charged for a crime, we say that Prison FC has signed X. Sometimes if there are multiple new “signings” in a short period of time, then Prison FC is deemed to have had a strong transfer window.

I was just wondering whether the same could be done for the NBA

If the NBA made a new expansion team, but the only players allowed to play for the team would be those with criminal charges or those accused, then who would make the team? Both in the starting 5 and also on the bench?

Who would be the GM, head coach or any other staff position ? Or even owner? Who would make the all-time team? What would the RS record for the current roster be?

One thing - in football we usually include the most high-profile cases (half of them are sex-offenders such as Mason Greenwood or Adam Johnson) so it would be easier to use higher-profile NBA cases to make a roster

He had Steve Ballmer going to Raptors games and he went to some, too. **We were warned that no more Clippers players, coaches or employees could go to games in Toronto. We were sending guys to go sit in the stands.**

317,2022-09-03 15:20:31,"What players could still possibly be on the move this off-season, despite a lack of reports on teams’ interest in them?","Reports tend to be on the big name players like Irving, Durant, and Mitchell, with all being pretty much set in their current destination. Westbrook is the only big name left (maybe Randle also?), and the lakers can either trade him to Indy or Utah (with returns including Hield, Turner, Bogdanovic, etc.), or they can just run it back. 

However, what about the names flying under the radar that you believe could still possibly be moved this off-season? Is there a player that really doesn’t fit their team’s timeline atm? 

For example, the Spurs seem to have been forgotten about regarding that Tank for Wembanyama. They’ve moved Dejounte, are looking to continue to develop Keldon, Vassell, Primo, but what about the rest of the roster? Where could Poeltl possibly end up?

Another one is Capela with the Hawks. I’ve heard lots of fans wanting to have Okongwu take the starting spot to have him develop alongside Trae, Collins, and Murray. Do you agree with this take? Any possible destinations for Capela?

Finally, we’re really just wondering what the Hornets plan is. They’re not nearly good enough to contend, but don’t seem to want to tank. I personally believe they should ship Rozier and Hayward out for picks and youth. Plumlee and Oubre possibly as well. As of right now, Lamelo, PJ, Williams, Bouknight? Kai Jones? That’s not all that spectacular for a young core. (Besides Lamelo, but who knows if he’ll want to remain there when a new contract approaches)

There’s also been a long flirtation with former first-round pick Cam Reddish, who the team was linked to last season at the deadline and over this offseason.

>Sources say the Lakers are comfortable heading into training camp with Westbrook on their roster, hoping new coach Darvin Ham can unlock increased intensity on defense while another season with James and Davis makes life easier on offense. 

>The argument for that, of course, is if the Lakers can’t build into a true contender via trade this month, wait and handle it down the road either through free agency or future trades. A bad deal now that forces them to offload one or two future firsts wouldn’t dramatically raise the ceiling on this year’s team and handcuff them even more down the road, sort of a worst-case scenario for the organization.

>Still, it’s hard not to envision how redoing the Westbrook deal — sending out the former MVP for multiple playable pieces — wouldn’t make the Lakers better in the short term.

>The question they’re mulling, though, is if any of the options facing them today make them good enough.

358,2022-09-02 10:47:07,Darius Garland is better than people think he is.,"Now that Donovan Mitchell has been traded a lot of attention has been directed to Cleveland, making it a good time to release an opinion I have had for a while. This will be an analysis devoid of advanced stats since I'm too lazy to learn how those work, instead it will be a mix of context, little bit of film, and basic stats.

I'd say most people put Darius somewhere in the top 25-35 players, rankings are overblown in terms of importance but I believe Darius has a solid argument for being a top 20 talent.

**Stats are Better then they seem**

Garland's average for the year was **21.7 points, 8.6 assist, and 3.3 rebounds on 46.2/38.3/89.2 splits**. Nearly having a 22 and 10 statline with above-average efficiency is an incredible player, an all-star talent at least but he is actually more impressive then that. According to Statmuse, [Link](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask?q=darius+garland+stats+last+40+games+of+the+2021-2022+season), Darius Garland in his last forty games (which is half a season, a more than reasonable sample size) averaged **23.7 points, 9.5 assists and 3.5** **on 45.1/37.7/88.6** splits. So now he jumps to nearly 24 and 10 on similar efficiency, but even the efficiency is way better than it looks.

**Efficiency is Misleading**

Darius has poor spacing on his team, [Cleveland Catch and Shoot Stats](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/catch-shoot/?Season=2021-22&SeasonType=Regular%20Season&CF=TEAM_ABBREVIATION*E*CLE:GP*GE*20&sort=CATCH_SHOOT_FG3_PCT&dir=1)

He had two shooters at least 40 percent from three, in comparison OKC had four, three if you feel Olivier Sarr's sample size is too low. He is usually kicking out to players like Cedi and Okoro regularly.

If you watch the film, [Every ""Driving Layup"" Darius Garland Attempted](https://www.nba.com/stats/events/?CFID=50&CFPARAMS=Driving%20Layup%20Shot&ContextMeasure=FGA&GameID=&PlayerID=1629636&Season=2021-22&SeasonType=Regular%20Season&TeamID=&flag=3&sct=plot&section=game). Darius is regularly attacking the basket with 2 to 3 players near or in the paint.

His three-ball is also better than perceived not only because of volume but because he is rarely being set up on his threes. The best shooters in the league earned their stats through hard work but also by being set up, Desmond Bane and Duncan Robinson (when he was elite) were not taking pullups and step backs from three. If you look back at the Cleveland catch and shoot stats Darius takes 3 catch and shoot threes, the other four threes he takes are off the dribble.

It is similar to Luka, if you watch Luka you know this guy is an incredible shooter but his numbers from three don't reflect that. The truth with Luka is that he takes a lot of step backs and off the dribble shots, because no one can set him up. The same thing with Darius but not as bad, Darius is the Cleveland offense. Rondo can do a good job of keeping the team afloat, but if you ask Cleveland fans you will know that offense is rough without Darius.

**Playoff Team w/ Lackluster Talent**

He has also proven that he can win games, [Standing Throughout the Season](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2022_standings_by_date_eastern_conference.html). From December 9th to March 3rd they were a guaranteed playoff team as the best player. Let's not forget how many injuries that team went through. After Allen went out that is when the team's record fell, but wouldn't most teams fall if there most impactful defense player who is also one of their primary scorers gets hurt?

Bad comps, but still came to mind:

* 2007-08 Celtics: Rondo + Allen (guards) + KG & Perkins (bigs).  But Rondo was primarily a defensive player at this time and Allen was an above-average defender.
* 2009-10 Lakers: Bynum & Pau (bigs) + Kobe & Fisher (guards).  But Pau and Kobe were 2-way, Kobe wasn't short, and Fisher was more defensive than offensive.
* 2014-15 Mavs: Dirk & Chandler (bigs) + Ellis & Jameer Nelson (guards).  Obviously Dirk was offensive, Ellis & Nelson weren't close to all-star level",True,19,0.71,31,/r/nba/comments/x4jttt/when_was_the_last_time_there_was_a_lineup_like/,macro_maniac_429

**In the GOAT Busdriver Discussion**

**Bill Russell** remains the championship king, going 8/8 in his All-NBA years. However, he only defeated 11x 50 win teams as an All NBA player, and enjoyed most of his success with only 8-10 teams in the NBA.

**Michael Jordan** we know went 6/6, is 2nd on the list of 50 win teams defeated, and is 1st on the list of 60 win teams defeated. He had a much shorter playoff timespan than the others in the discussion, with only 11 playoff berths as an All-NBA player. 

**LeBron James** comes in 1st in both Conference Titles and Playoff Berths as an All-NBA player. While he did play in a weaker conference a majority of his career, he still racked up 18 wins against 50 win teams, and is the only All-NBA player in league history to defeat a 70 win team. He has the least amount of championships of the players in the discussion with 4. 

**NBA's GOAT Busdriver**

**Kobe Bryant** is the only player Top 3 in Championships, Conference Titles, and Playoff Berths as an All-NBA player. He also dominates the 50 win teams defeated list with 24, 5 more than any other player in an All-NBA season. This gives Kobe Bryant the title as the NBA's GOAT Busdriver.",True,0,0.48,73,/r/nba/comments/x4zlws/nbas_goat_busdriver_player_with_the_most_playoff/,allthatglittersis___
367,2022-09-02 09:48:31,"[RealGM] With the Cleveland Cavaliers trading for Donovan Mitchell, they created one potential issue concerning the next contract of Evan Mobley.","Because the Cavaliers now have Mitchell and Darius Garland on their roster as five-year designated rookie scale max extension players, they cannot have a third player simultaneously. 

Mobley will be eligible for a five-year max extension in 2024, but he will have to wait until he is a restricted free agent in 2025 to sign a five-year max if both Mitchell and Garland remain on the Cavaliers' roster at that time. Mobley can alternatively sign a four-year max extension in 2024, which would make him an unrestricted free agent one season earlier.

Brandon Ingram is a player who recently signed a five-year max contract in restricted free agency instead of an extension coming off his rookie contract, which gives him a different designation.

 “It’s hard day for me as a Knicks fan. As a reporter knowing exactly what went on behind the scenes of this trade, then analyzing it as a Knicks fan, there is no reason Donovan should be headed to Cleveland.  “Donovan Mitchell should have been headed to New York.” 

 “The Knicks got too cute and they got too egotistical… They decided to lowball the Utah Jazz, & the Jazz took their business elsewhere.  “That’s literally what happened here.” 

 “I can’t tell you exactly what the New York Knicks’ final offer was because the source on this is really good, but I will tell you that it’s worse than the offer that the Jazz accepted. 

 “And I’ll tell you this: The Jazz were prepared to accept an offer this weekend that, if they had accepted that offer, everybody on social media would have said NYK won the trade. But the Jazz were prepared to accept that offer.” 

 “The an offer that the Jazz were prepared to accept, from everything that has been reported… there was an offer that it would have been clear once it came out had it been accepted that the Jazz relented significantly. And the Knicks said NO.” 

 “and they back to the table and came back with a worse offer than that. And that’s when the Jazz were like “no. we’re good.” 

 “The Utah Jazz would have gotten: -RJ Barrett -Immanuel Quickley -2 unprotected  -2 picks swaps -2 seconds -Expirings (not Fournier)  “The Jazz were going to accept. The Knicks said no. That was this weekend.” 

 “The Knicks came back with this offer Monday night: -RJ Barrett -2 FRPs  “It didn’t have the 2nds. It didn’t have the swaps.”  “That’s when the Jazz said ‘we’re good’ and decided to take their business elsewhere.” 

 The Jazz were like ‘we’re done’ and they went to Cleveland, asked for Abaji in the package, got it, and accepted Cleveland’s offer. 

 “The Knicks would have kept: -Grimes -Toppin -2 of their unprotected 1sts -the bulk of their protected 1sts  “There was internal disagreement on the Jazz to offer that deal. And the Knicks came back with a worse offer than that. It was just purely egotistical.” 

 “When I talked to the Knicks on Monday night, one thing they said was ‘we believe that they’ll come back to the table.’  “It was just a complete & utter ego play by the Knicks. & the Jazz said ‘ok we’re gonna trade him to Cleveland.”

For example, the players that the Jazz currently want amid their deconstruction bid to the bottom. 

If Danny Ainge's moves essentially say,  ""Yeah, we will dump all our best players to accumulate picks down the road, and we are ok acknowledging that we are going to suck for a few years. In fact, the more we suck now, the better it is for our future. ... and you are just the type of player we want to keep on the squad while we do this."" ... how do players feel this reflects on them?

Does their ego take a hit, or does the hubris required to be one of the best in the world at something prevent them from taking an honest assessment of the situation?

The easy answers are that all players hate to lose, or that their bank accounts can ease their suffering. ... but those not what I'm talking about, exactly.

I guess I wonder if it causes players to look in the mirror and say, ""Damn, this team that is obviously trying to lose wants me. I better get my shit together.""

I took the last 20 years of NBA per game data at only kept any All-Stars (voted in, injured, & replacements included). This is what is my definition of a ""Star"".

# The averages of this ""Star"" were:

**Age** 27.363

**G** 70.594

**GS** 70.173

* Descriptive Attributes

The average star in the NBA is 27 years old, in the early to middle of their career. They play around 71 games a year for an average of 86% of the season (82 games a year). Starting all of these games and playing 83% of the minutes in a single game (42 minutes).

* Performance

Over the last 20 years the average NBA star posted the following stats per game: Points : 21.66 Assists : 4.85 Rebounds : 7.16 Blocks : 0.84 Steals : 1.23 Turnovers : 2.70 FT : 4.79 PF : 2.42

* Efficency

An NBA star also has efficency with a FG% of 48.1%. From inside the arc a star shoots 51%, and behind the arc 31.9%. This equates to a effective field goal percent of 52%. A star has an assist to tunroner ratio of 1.80x.

I then took 10% and 20% downward variance of these averages and filtered the 2021-2022 NBA per game data for all players. I removed all names that were in the 2021-22 All-Star Game. I also filtered them to be ***either*** an offensive or defensive star. So with the variance for FG%, PTS, AST, 3P%, 2P%, FT, and eFG% ***or*** TRB, BLK, STL.

# 10% Variance Results:

Shai Gileous-Alexander

De'Aarron Fox

Brandon Ingram

Bam Adebayo

20% Variance Results:

Shai Gilgous-Alexander

De'Aarron Fox

Brandon Ingram

Bam Adebayo

Pascal Siakam

Brandon Ingram

Julius Randle

Bam Adebayo

Domantas Sabonis

Nikola Vucecic

Andre Drummond

Scottie Barnes

# Analysis:

So altogether on the 20% variance we seen more names, and I think a 20% gap on any which skills is improbable to become a star player in 1-2 years. Of the 10 players that came up 7 were former all-stars but didn't make it this past year. I will consider these guys the fringe-fringe stars in any given season given their situation. The 3 guys that are interesting are Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, De'Aaron Fox, and ROY Scottie Barnes. SGA and Fox seem to need to be better rebounders and need to take care of the ball better. Scottie Barnes needs better offense across the board and to take care of the ball better. It should be fun to watch these guys over the next year.

For fun I also wanted to see if any player were within 10% variance in all categories. Only 2 showed up; the MVP (Jokic) and Lebron.

Perhaps by the year 2100 the NBA looks drastically different. One idea i would kinda like is if basketball removed dribbling altogether. Obviously crazy, but how would  people feel the NBA  removed the travel call of passing the ball from one hand to the other  It would allow for more creativity for offensive players and it removes the issue of creating space that also causes issues for defenders called for blocking. Does any one like this idea to implement it? Thanks

""It is a companion to the Hart Trophy, which is awarded to the NHL's MVP of the regular season, as judged by members of the Professional Hockey Writer's Association.""

It seems to me that there are clear examples where a lot of arguments and big egos would be made irrelevant if the delineation of ""Most Valuable"" and ""Most Outstanding"" was woven into the awards process.  Plus, having players do the voting is great for the game, in my opinion.  Maybe the NBA is too individualistic in its marketing and image (an image that is much more globally popular than ice hockey) to warrant a change.  It seems like much of the NBA image is about who is the best player anyways (not the best team, at least for marketing) and removing controversy over which player is the best unnecessarily lowers the stakes, and therefore fan involvement, in award ceremonies.

But really, I think fans are more and more interested in the science and analysis of the game and somewhat less  in the spectacle (although that is still the core of any sport, and especially basketball).

With Golbert and Donovan being dealt in return for a literal HAUL of good draft picks and players (and not scrubs either) they seem to be in a solid position to be fighting for a top 5 seed again in the west in maybe 2 seasons.

Look at OKC. They have like 15-17 first round picks over the next 5 drafts. They have young talent (Despite Holmgren's injury) and have a solid core to build around. They can package a lot of those picks and do a reverse Golbert/Donovan and get a lot of star power in return.

While Fox’s jump was largely attributed to no longer having a clogged backcourt, I believe what really helped was Sabonis’ skill in screening and playmaking. Sabonis was second in the league for screen assists in the 21-22 season with 5.5 per game and his passing in the post led to a flurry of easy cuts that had Fox reaping benefits he never knew. The Kings ball movement and offense was a far cry from what it used to be. 

Fox is set to have the best season of his career with Kings GM Monte McNair assembling the best team Fox will have ever played on with the additions of Malik Monk, Kevin Huerter and Keegan Murray along with finally having someone in the same tier as him in Domantas Sabonis.

**Shaq**: 40.1pts on 112 TS+

**Wilt**: Unfortunately per 100 is not available for the 60s so Wilt can't be compared straight up, though he did average 50.4ppg on 112 TS+

I remember seeing this video around the time it came out, and it still holds up as the worst display of acting I’ve seen. I know we’re supposed to cut pro athletes some slack when it comes to this stuff, but my god, this is ass.

Here are some of the standout moments:

- Monty Williams’ “pre-game” speech where it sounds like he’d rather ~~lose by 40 in a Game 7 in front of an international audience~~ be anywhere else in the world than that kitchen.

- AD’s forced wink at the camera after showing Ryan Anderson how to dunk a mozzarella stick in sauce. I haven’t been this uncomfortable since seeing his Kentucky locker room vid.

- The hilariously obvious cut from Tyreke Evans to a hand model drizzling sauce on his dish.

- Ryan Anderson looks like he’s about to bust out laughing at any given moment.

- **My personal favourite**: Pelicans owner Tom Benson (RIP) blurting out his line “Woo! I thought you guys looked familiar!” without looking at any of the players or coach. Maybe he was sitting in front of a mirror?

528,2022-08-31 23:38:07,The Greatest Contract Years in NBA History,"The last few off-seasons there has been so much talk about people who “fumbled the bag”. So instead I want to talk about the players who REALLY earned the bag, to get to the greatest contract years of all time.

First, a few qualifications

1. We’re talking about a big bag for players who haven’t already made a boat load of money. So not late career resurgences that were parlayed into big contracts
2. We’re talking about contract years where players played way better than the rest of their careers. So not players who have previously already been great or shown flashes (ala Chandler Parsons)
3. We’re talking about years that are outliers. Not players who played themselves into a massive bag entering free agency, but then also was worth that money (ala Tracy McGrady)
4. The immediate drop after getting paid matters. If you played just as well or only slightly worse after getting the bag it doesn’t count (ala Hassan Whiteside & Dion Waiters)
5. We’re talking about players who were VERY good during the contract year. And not just GM’s giving money to players who weren’t even producing (ala Mozgov)

Honorable mentions: Similar to #5 on this list, Evan Turner and Bismack Biyombo both parlayed some playoff success into major bags. Though both were young lottery picks who flashed a lot of potential in their careers.

So without furth adieu, the greatest contract year’s leagues in history

**#5 2004-2005 Jerome James (Seattle Sonics, signs a 5 year 30 million dollar deal with the Knicks)**

While the contract itself wasn’t enormous, the way he got it is so phenomenal that one might not even qualify it as a contract year. A career backup who never averaged more than 17 minutes per game in his first 6 years, James would reliably average 5 points and 3-4 rebounds pretty much every year. Then come the 2005 NBA playoffs, where James catches fire. Doubling his minutes average, he goes for 17.2ppg and 9.4rpg against the Kings while shooting 58%, with 12.5-7 over the entire playoffs including guarding Tim Duncan.

**How nuts was the contract year?:** He signs with the Knicks and well, goes back to being Jerome James. He plays 90 games in the next 4 years, averaging 2.5ppg and under 10 minutes a game before retiring due to injury.

**#4 2004-2005 Bobby Simmons (LA Clippers, signs a 5 year 47 million dollar deal with the Bucks)**

For the first 3 years, Bobby simmons was just bench fodder. He started a total of 13 games and was mostly inefficient, with sub .500 TS% and non-existent 3pt shooting.

Then in 2005 he explodes. 16.4-5.9-2.7, all career highs, with 1.5 steals to boot. His shooting splits were a ridiculous 47/44/85, while playing behind ball dominant players like Elton Brand and Corey Maggette. A season that came so out of nowhere he crushed the Most Improved Player voting, with 4x more first place votes than runner-up Dwayne Wade, who had ascended to stardom in his second year.

**How nuts was the contract year?**: It seemed like Bobby Simmons was the perfect compliment to the young core of Michael Redd and Andrew Bogut. Nope. Redd gets worse at rebounding, scoring and efficiency every year. A mysterious heel and ankle injury somehow keeps him out for a full season a year later, and Simmons was never the same, averaging below 8ppg for the rest of his career.

**#3 2019-2020 Davis Bertans (Washington Wizards, re-sign him for 5 years, 80 million)**

Because he’s been somewhat of a meme, I think we don’t really appreciate how incredible Davis Bertans contract year was.

In his first 3 seasons, Bertans was a good shooter that averaged 6ppg per game. Then in year 4 he explodes for 15.4ppg while setting career high numbers in blocks, rebounds and even finally started getting to the line.

But it was how he did it that stood out. He shoots 42.4% from deep, the 6th best mark in the league, and took more attempts than anyone above him. Only Duncan Robinson was better in terms of efficiency at that volume. Per game he was 4th in 3 point makes and 7th in attempts. If you want to know how difficult it is to shoot that efficiently at that clip, 12 players took 8 or more 3’s per game that season. Every single one besides Bertans and Robinson shot 40% or worse (including Luka with a gross 32% shooting). In fact, in the **entire history of the NBA,** of the 74 individual seasons where players have shot 8+ 3's per game the only players who were more efficient than Bertans were Klay Thompson (2015-2016), Duncan Robinson (2019-2020), and Steph Curry (3 times). It was arguably the greatest big man shooting individual season of all time.

**How nuts was the contract year?**: He got the major bag, and was never as efficient again, getting traded a year and a half later to the Mavs. While he was showing signs of life after the trade, he was still significantly less efficient than his contract year.

**#2 2003-2004 Erick Dampier (Golden State Warriors, signs a 7 year 73 million deal with the Mavericks)**

For 7 years Erick Dampier was an often injured, unspectacular big man for the Warriors. Despite having the frame of a prototypical big man at 6’11 and 265 pounds, he was kind of just…there. A slightly above average rebounder who was a decent shot blocker and couldn’t make a bucket to save his life. Not only did he shoot below .500 in his first 7 years, he only had one season above 45%, and **four seasons of 40% or worse**.

Then he finally gets to his contract year. The guy plays more minutes than he ever has to the tune of 12-12 and 2 bocks per game, shooting a blistering 54% from the field, eclipsing his career highs of 11.8ppg and 8.7rpg that were set in his SECOND year in the league.

**How nuts was the contract year?:** At 29, he signed the contract worth significantly more than his 8 year career. While the mavs made the finals with Dampier as a starter, he never averaged double digit rebounds or points again. He would block way less shots, and he simply just refused to shoot anymore. Despite this, Erick Dampier claimed he was the 2nd best center in the West. Meanwhile, whenever Shaq would play poorly he would say ""I played like Erick Dampier out there"".

**#1 2004-2005 Larry Hughes (Washington Wizards, signs a 5 year 70 million dollar deal with the Cavaliers)**

Entering his 7th year, Larry Hughes was already on his 3rd team. Though he showed some flashes with the Warriors earlier in his career, averaging 20+ ppg over 30 games, he had trouble reaching those heights again. And while he had found some success on the Wizards, he was playing 3rd banana to Antawn Jamison and Gilbert Arenas.

Then in 2005, he has a career year. He averages 22-6.3-4.7, all career highs, while shooting 43% (as a career 40% shooter). He even got to the line 7.4 times per game, also a career high.

What makes his contract year so special though? He also did it on defense. He lead the league with an insane 2.9 steals per game (his previous career high was 1.9), while straight locking down guys on the perimeter and was a menace in passing lanes. He did this all while being one of the skinniest players in the league. He parlayed that into a NBA All-defensive 1st team spot, and a big contract with the Cavs.

**How nuts was the contract year?:** Everyone thought he was going to be the perfect 2nd star to lebron james. Instead, not only was his contract year a career year, but the rest of his career was a dud. For his remaining 7 years, he never shoots above 41% again, never averages over 16ppg, and his steal rate plummets reverting back to his pre-contract year levels. He also just wasn’t even close defensively, and got bounced around the league for teams thinking he can get back to “wizard level” Larry.

---

What's craziest to me is that 4 of these all happened within 2 years of each other, and its possible its made it so that GM's are better at sniffing out these contract years.

If you guys have any I missed, let me know! Thanks for reading

Edit: Someone has mentioned Charlie Villanueva and that definitely counts. 11ppg player, who then jumps to 16ppg, gets the bag, and goes back to exactly 11ppg the next few seasons.

Edit 2: Ok this one should've made the list. Dana Barros averaged 9ppg for the first 5 years of his career. Out of nowhere becomes a 20ppg scorer with 3.3 rebounds, 7.5 ast, on insane 49/46/90 splits. Leads to his first all star appearance. Signs a 6 year 22m contract in 1995 and never reaches even close to those heights again.

Basically the highest honour in the NRL is to be named an Immortal. These players are named as the greatest ever to play the sport and it is such an exclusive club that there have only been 13 named out of the nearly 115 years the sport has been played in Australia.

These players are voted on by some of the most esteemed coaches, commentators, media members and the other living Immortals that are involved in the sport.

The Immortals are also chosen based purely on their playing ability and nothing else.

At the moment there are only 3 living immortals. Having said that there is maybe one or 2 recently retired players who will probably end up as Immortals in the future.

Ben Simmons and fiancée Maya Jama have ended their engagement, The Post can confirm.

The Nets star and British television personality were unable to make their relationship work due to their busy schedules and long distance.

“It’s been a difficult time for them,” a source close to the couple told The Post. “While they both care for each other so much, they truly gave it their all and realize that they just come from two different worlds. They now understand they don’t have the time they thought to dedicate to this relationship.”

After many long nights and hours of heartfelt talks, they finally realized as much as they love each other, their nonstop careers and endless travel have made it incredibly impossible to make it work, the source said.

“They had no idea the challenges they would face when handling all the logistics of making a life together in two countries,” the source continued, adding that the decision to end their engagement is “one of the hardest decisions of their lives.”

>The Jazz’s final counteroffer to the Knicks to land Donovan Mitchell was RJ Barrett, Immanuel Quickley, three unprotected picks, multiple pick swaps, plus potentially another young player. New York declined, so Utah accepted the Cavaliers’ offer.

>At the start of trade talks in July, New York offered Utah a Donovan Mitchell package including RJ Barrett, Obi Toppin, Mitchell Robinson and three unprotected first-round picks, sources tell ESPN.

So the Jazz declined the bigger one in July and asked for a smaller one in August?

Now [Shams](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/x3j667/charania_they_had_everything_necessary_to_get_a/) is saying that the Knicks offered a smaller package as their final offer

>They had everything necessary to get a deal done ... in their last offer they put on the table RJ Barrett, Immanuel Quickley, two unprotected first-round picks but Danny Ainge and the Utah Jazz wanted more.

So basically the Knicks offered a massive package in July which was declined

Knicks offered a smaller package in August which was then countered with a smaller package than the July package?

Idk to me this doesn't add up and sounds like damage control from both sides

Knicks want to make it seem like they offered a lot to make Utah seem dumb

Utah wants to make it seem like the Knicks were low balling them to make the Knicks seem dumb.

The rule is that a team can only have *two players* on designated rookie max extensions. A side rule is that only one of these two players can be acquired from a trade (which caused some issues with the Nets/Ben Simmons earlier this offseason). 

This is NOT currently an issue for the Cavs. They have two players on designed rookie max extensions: Darius Garland and Donovan Mitchell. Only one was traded for: Donovan Mitchell. 

However, this can potentially be a serious problem when Evan Mobley is due for his designated rookie max. Keep in mind that a designated rookie max extension is signed before a player hits FA, so Mobley would be eligible after his third NBA season in 2024. 

Mobley is on trajectory to sign this type of contract based on his rookie season. However, he literally cannot sign this contract if both Garland and Mitchell are on the team. What is a solution to get around this? Does Mitchell have to waive his 5th year player option and does that solve the issue?

It looks like the Jazz are primed to end this streak. Their roster as it stands is probably not bad enough to go 22-60, but it's possible. If they make no further trades they probably win around 26-28 games.

Jimmy Butler, on the other hand, is a player that’s hard to gauge. Looking at his regular season numbers, which are impressive, but don’t scream “all time great.” Jimmy is such a smart player, and his contributions go far beyond the stat sheet.

He had 13.4 PPG in the 5 seasons prior and after.","His 26.5 PPG in '91 was 6th in the league and was higher than known scorers Dominique Wilkins, Chris Mullin, David Robinson, Mitch Richmond, and Kevin Johnson.

The 10.5 APG, meanwhile, ranked 3rd, only trailing future HOFers John Stockton and Magic Johnson.

Adams rose from a bench warmer in Sacramento and Washington to starter when he got sent to Denver in 1987, where he was the floor general for Doug Moe's high-octane offense. 

Moe was replaced by Paul Westhead heading into the 90-91 season, a coach who's offense is even more aggressive. Westhead was fresh-off a 5-year stint at Loyola Marymount, the inspiration for the 30 for 30 doc, The Guru of Go.

Adams thrived under Westhead's system as the two basically architected a classic all offense team. The 91 Nuggets ranked first in points (119.9) and dead-last in points allowed (130.8). They bottomed-out in the West.

As expected with a putrid 20-62 record, it became a one-off. The 28-year-old guard was shipped back to DC in the summer of 91 for future picks.

Fun fact: Adams was traded alongside a future first-round pick that turned out to be... LaBradford Smith.

#1 is clearly Lebron. I don't think much needs to be said here.

#2 in my opinion is Steph. He changed the way the game is played and is the main engine behind one of the most dominant teams in NBA history.

That leaves spot #3. I imagine most people would go with KD and I understand why. He has dominated since he entered the league and has stacked up a crazy amounts of career statistics and accolades.

Kawhi, on the other hand, has had a much slower rise, going from a role player to the superstar he is today. While he doesn't have KD's career accolades in terms of points, MVP, and sustained success, his best moments are significantly more memorable than KDs. That 2019 run was one of the greatest runs we have ever seen and produced several iconic moments, which was ultimately capped of with a championship for a champion-chip starved city.

>I think they are going to ramp it up (trade talks) before training camp and get more aggressive from what I’ve been told, but whether that aggression includes giving up two first-round picks, I still like they’re going to fight to try to keep that second first-round pick.

If anything, Ainge is going to try and get them both unprotected like he’s trying to do with the Knicks and get as many unprotected picks as possible (for Donovan Mitchell).

While it's remarkable how good Lebron has been over the last 20 years or so, longevity is largely a byproduct of era and it will become more and more regular as the game moves forward. Players of the past didn't have the luxury of spending millions on state of the art body maintenance technologies to lengthen their careers, and didn't take care of their bodies to the same degree as today. That's why I think a much better factor in defining a player's greatness is their peak, just the pinnacle of their basketball ability and what they were able to do at their best.

636,2022-09-02 07:04:51,Donovan Mitchell's Basketball Impact,"Here's a post I wrote two months for my Cavs subreddit. After the very first Mitchell to Cleveland rumor was announced, the hometown sub was sharing all sorts of ridiculous comments about Mitchell. I wrote the below analysis and ended up appreciating Mitchell more.

\-

Donovan Mitchell is underrated.

Rumored in Cavs trade rumors, probably with little credibility or much possibility, but still fun to discuss, is Mitchell to the Cavs. I've seen debates if Mitchell is that much better than Sexton, if he’s a borderline top 10 offensive player, if he’s a top 20 player, if he’s a top 20 offensive player, etc.

I’ve seen it on r nba some as well. Mitchell is being underrated for common mistakes: people over prioritize team results during the last playoffs, over prioritize guard defense, over prioritize size.

What’s most important is guard offense that beats not only “guard defense,"" but what’s most important to winning a championship is perimeter offensive superstars that break *team defense*. This post will focus on his offense, which I’ve seen mostly underrated, and sometimes wildly underrated.

Let's set the record on Mitchell's impact.

\-

DARKO is the best public metric, according to most GMs. My main judgment is that it’s a decent objective rough starting point for rankings.

Mitchell is ranked 19th overall, above Jrue Holiday and below Devin Booker. He’s 9th on offense, close to Booker again, Kyrie, and Giannis. On defense he’s by Booker again lol, Lillard, worse than Kyrie.

Mitchell as a Booker comp is a reasonable starting point, thank you, DARKO.

We need a Booker with Mobley and Garland. Mitchell’s just turning 25, the same age as Booker, entering the beginning of their primes.

People focus on the Jazz loss in the playoffs, yeah, that was a surprise and an upset. That doesn’t negate **averaging 28.3 ppg and 3.3 threes per game in the playoffs in his 39 game career before his prime.** He averaged **over 32 ppg through ten games two playoffs ago**, and before that he led the first round in scoring as a 23 year old with 36.3 ppg in the 7 game series loss to Denver.

**The Jazz were first in offensive rating last year with an elite 116.2 Team O Rating.** **Mitchell led the league’s number one offense in field goal attempts, threes made, steals, turnovers, and was second in free throws and assists.**

Let’s look at per 100 possession rankings for an equal footing with pace and mpg. **Mitchell was 6th in points per possession** after Embiid, Giannis, Luka, Trae, and Jokic. **Mitchell was 7th in threes per 100 possessions** after Curry, Beasley, Mclemore, Strus, Robinson, and Love. **Mitchell was also 7th in total threes this season** despite missing 15 games, so he had the volume.

**Mitchell was 21st in the league in FTs made per 100 possessions. Cleveland’s top player in this was Kevin Love at 34th,** who's an example of low volume distorting the rankings, and he’s not someone the Cavs can depend on to win when Garland and Mobley are getting closer to their primes and UFAs. Don’t tell me Mitchell doesn’t fill a need. **Mitchell was 19th in the league in FTs made per game. Cavs best by a lot was Garland ranked 28th.**

**Donovan Mitchell was third in threes per game last year.** The Cavs were in the bottom third last year. Yes he fills the Cavs most important needs. 1. Dynamic shooting and 2. Free throws

Now that you have a better idea of how Mitchell played basketball last year, remember he was the first option on the league’s number one offense. He creates elite team offense while drawing first option team defensive attention. He had good teammates but mostly past their primes. He wasn’t playing with Garland and Mobley. If Garland and Mobley are worth their salt, and I believe they will be, then the game is easier for Mitchell here, and he’ll make the game easier for them.

It’s demonstrable that Mitchell helps make his teammates more efficient. Including regular season + playoffs minutes, when **Mitchell was on the and Bogdanovic off, the Jazz had a 118.9 O Rating and 59.6% TS. When Bogdanovic was on and Mitchell was off the Jazz were 111.8 O Rating and 55.8 TS%. With Clarkson w/o Mitchell = 114.6 O Rating, with Mitchell w/o Clarkson = 117 O Rating. With Conley w/o Mitchell = 114 O Rating, With Mitchell w/o Conley Jazz were 120.3 O Rating.**",True,0,0.43,35,/r/nba/comments/x3zsnw/donovan_mitchells_basketball_impact/,suphater

641,2022-09-01 00:38:18,The similarities between the 1984 draft and 2018 draft are very interesting.,"With the 1st overall pick, both Houston and Pheonix selected a homegrown big man prospect in Hakeem and Ayton. Obviously they are miles apart in play but they share the similarly of both being born in foreign countries, and then playing college basketball in the city of the NBA team that would select them #1 overall in their respective drafts.

Then with the 2nd overall pick, both the Blazers and Kings selected big men who most would consider busts. Both of them chose these busts right before the best players avaiable in the draft. Both of them also chose said big men because of 'fit'. Blazers didn't want MJ, who went afterwards, because he played the same position as Clyde Drexler, their rising superstar. The Kings chose Marvin Bagley ahead of Luka because they thought he would a better fit with their rising star, De'Aaron Fox.

The best player (so far) of both drafts went #3 overall, MJ and Luka Doncic. One is already an all time great, arguably the greatest ever and the other is already on the trajectory to be one of the all time greats. Both didn't have much help early on in their career but put on individual shows, put their teams on their back and carried them to the playoffs and also put on all time great performances in the postseason. Obviously whether Luka eventually gets help and wins as much as MJ did in the post season is still to be seen of course.

With the #5 overall pick in the draft, two very good players in Charles Barkley and Trae Young were selected by the Sixers and Hawks respectively. They aren't the best players from the draft but no one would hesitate to say that they are 3rd and 2nd best from it respectively. Both of them are also undersized for their respective positions but have dominated regardless of the fact. Charles Barkley won one MVP in his career and most people would agree that Trae Young has an extremely  good chance at winning one sometime in his career too.",True,35,0.79,24,/r/nba/comments/x2zfp2/the_similarities_between_the_1984_draft_and_2018/,Saransh69

646,2022-08-31 17:16:48,Is K.C. Jones the luckiest man to ever pick up a basketball?,"I was having a conversation with my father recently regarding Bill Russell and being the stats junky I am I looked into his championship winning years. I came away from that rabbit hole surprised. Not with Bill’s amazing accolades, but with KC jones’ ability to be in the right place right time for nearly his entire basketball career. I went in to a deep dive and can say I believe KC must have done something in a previous life to deserve such astounding luck for an otherwise average to above average player. 

Let me explain: KC’s most enduring legacy as a player is as a ballhawk who played scrappy and mostly focused on the defensive end of the ball. With career averages of 7.4 points, 3.5 rebounds and 4.3 assists a game you would not believe the amount of basketball success this man has accomplished in his lifetime. Now this is not to take anything away from KC’s mind for the game and understanding of basketball but I do believe he was indeed in the right place at the right time more than any other athlete in history given his overall skill level. 

Through 1955-1956 he helped lead San Francisco university to two national championships. The star player on that team? Not KC but a more familiar name; his good friend BILL RUSSELL.

Following this he won a gold medal in the 1956 Olympic Games. Once again anchored by Bill.

He then proceeds to get drafted by the Celtics in the same year and wins a championship in his first 8 seasons with arguably the greatest dynasty in American sports history once again following Bill to more unprecedented success, retiring from pro ball after his ninth and final season.

Finally deciding to put his basketball knowledge to the test he joins the coaching staff of Bill Sharman and helps lead the 1971-72 Lakers to an NBA championship and league record 33 game win streak. This team was led by a big 3 of Wilt Chamberlain, Jerry West and Gail Goodrich. All within his first year of coaching at the nba level.

After bouncing around to a few other clubs while pursuing a head coaching position and achieving success with the Washington  Bullets he ends up joining Bill Fitchs’ staff as an assistant coach winning more hardware in 1980-1981 as the team is led by a little known player by the name of Bird. He then is promoted to the head coaching position in 1983 and leads the C’s to 4 finals in 5 years winning two more in 1984 and 86. 

His last few years in the game was met with moderate success before deciding to finally hang it up in 1998. 

His accolades include:

As player:
8× NBA champion (1959–1966) 3rd all time only behind two former teammates; Bill Russell and Sam Jones.
No. 25 retired by Boston Celtics
2× NCAA champion (1955, 1956)
Consensus second-team All-American (1956)
No. 4 retired by San Francisco Dons

One of only 8 players to have achieved a “triple crown” (NCAA, Olympic, NBA) champion

As assistant coach:

2× NBA champion (1972, 1981)

As coach:

2× NBA champion (1984, 1986)
5× NBA All-Star Game head coach (1975, 1984–1987) 
Career record of 552-306 (.643)

All while never averaging more than 10 points in any given season.

671,2022-08-31 10:14:14,Eurobasket guide for NBA fans - team Slovenia,"The European Basketball championship starts tomorrow with many of the NBA starts participating including Giannis, Jokic and Doncic. 

Since it's the offseason, I figured some NBA fans might want to tune in to watch the games, but may be unfamiliar with the teams and players that don't play in the NBA. Here's a 'brief' overview of team Slovenia and the roster:

**TEAM OVERVIEW**:

**Strengths**:

* **Elite scoring and playmaking at the guard position:** Probably the best and deepest guard line-up in the tournament
* **Floor spacing**: Slovenia does a great job at spacing the floor with a pick and pop big in Tobey as well as stretch fours like Muric and Cancar
* **Pedigree**: Defending Eurobasket champions, been in high pressure situations before
* **Chemistry**: Great chemistry with many players returning from last Eurobasket and/or Olympics
* **Steals**: Good at generating steals and hard to stop in transition

**Weaknesses**:

* **Very thin at C:**  Danger of foul trouble (5 fouls allowed in international play)
* **Rebounding:** recently got outrebounded against Germany 56/27
* **Interior defense**
* **Best players Doncic and Dragic can be targeted on perimeter**
* **Playbook:** Slovenia has not shown many designed plays in their preparation games so far with their main weapon being the Luka pick and roll. The worry is that the offense is too predictable
* **Inconsistent shooting at the wing positions**: Muric/Z. Dragic/Blazic went 1/20 from deep in the last two World Cup qualifying matches

**Things to look out for**:

The Slovenian team that won Eurobasket 2017 played a fast paced game, that suited Goran Dragic and many other Slovenian players. The Olympic team however played a slower pace similar to the Dallas Mavericks. This years team has been doing a little of both depending on whether Luka is sitting or not. 

Additionally Slovenia has been at times forced to employ a small ball line-up when their two centers were in foul trouble. This line-up could be Slovenia's best with great spacing and defensive potential with constant switching. Watch for Slovenia to use this as a means to turn the game around in desperate moments.

**ROOSTER**:

NOTE: The NBA comparisons are to gauge the player playstyle, not quality. Also feel free to suggest other comparisons if you feel you have better ones. :)

**Aleksej Nikolić (6) – PG**

NBA comparison: **Raul Neto**

About:

A low-risk, low-reward player, with Goran back on the team, Nikolić will mostly play off the ball.

Characteristics:

* Small point guard, feisty defender
* Solid 3-point shooter
* Limited offensive arsenal

Role on Slovenian team:

Defense on opposing guards.

**Jaka Blažič (11) – SG/SF**

NBA comparison: **RJ Barret**

About:

Blažič has been starting games at SG for Slovenia during the recent two World Cup qualifying matches. Unfortunately, he has been playing bellow his capabilities and shot abysmally from deep going 0/8. If he gets his form back he could be a wild card on any given game however.

Characteristics:

* Athletic wing
* Inconsistent shooter
* Can score in bunches if he gets going
* Prone to bad decisions that more often than not result in turnover
* Fighter on defense, but tends to die on screens

Role on Slovenian team:

‘Defense’ and ‘3 point shooting’ in the starting line-up.

**Luka Dončić (77) – PG/SG/SF**

About: Luka Dončić 

Role on Slovenian team:

Same as on Dallas, the entire Slovenian offense will run through him.

**Vlatko Čančar (31)**  **–**  **PF**

About:

Slovenia’s 3rd current NBA player spent the majority of his NBA career on the Denver Nuggets’ bench. He suffered an injury during the 2021/2022 season just as his minutes were picking up.

While perhaps lacking in talent to become a start in the league, he has the potential to become an excellent role player.

About:

* Lengthy and strong defender, struggles against quicker players
* Excellent catch-and-shoot player
* Mainly a supporting player, but occasionally shows flashes of an ISO game

Role on Slovenian team:

Stretch four in the starting line-up.

**Mike Tobey (10) – C**

NBA comparison: **Spencer Hawes**

About:

Solid American center, who was naturalized by Slovenia for last year’s Olympics. Essential for the Slovenia team as the rare source of rebounding and rim protection.

Characteristics:

* Solid rim protection, pick-and-roll game
* Ok 3-point shooter, can pick-and-pop

Role on Slovenian team:

Starting center, main pick-and-roll/pop partner for Luka

**Goran Dragić (3)**  **–**  **PG/SG/SF**

About:

Goran Dragić returns to the Slovenian team following his retirement after Slovenia winning the last Eurobasket in 2017 where he won MVP. 

While many would say he is washed, Goran has done a good job of shifting his game more towards the perimeter and apart from the recent game with Germany has been a good source of instant offense for the Slovenian team. Against Estonia he went for 19p/6ass in just 18 minutes of play on 8/10 shooting (3/4 from deep). 

Role on Slovenian team:

Secondary creator.

**Žiga Samar (4)**  **- PG**

NBA comparison: **George Hill**

About:

Recently went undrafted in the 2022 NBA draft, where he was mocked around 65.

Characteristics:

* Smart pass-first player, knows how to run point.
* Big for PG, good defensive instincts

Role on Slovenian team:

Run the team when Luka and Goran are on the bench. Defense on opposing PGs.

**Klemen Prepelič (7)**  **- SG**

NBA comparison: **Seth Curry**

About:

A late bloomer, Klemen has slowly become one of the best shooters in Europe.

Characteristics:

* Great shooter off the catch and off movement.
* Can run point if necessary

Role on Slovenian team:

Spark plug off the bench.

**Zoran Dragić (30) – SG/SF**

NBA comparison: **Lance Stephenson**

About:

Goran’s younger brother never quite developed the skills to be a premium NBA or Euroleague player, but he brings a lot of grit to the Slovenian team.

Characteristics:

* Good slasher and transition scorer
* Feisty defender
* Inconsistent game to game, especially 3-point shooting
* Prone to playing above his skill level

Role on Slovenian team:

Defense and transition scoring.

**Edo Murić (8) – PF**

NBA comparison: **Georges Niang**

About:

A mainstay in the Slovenian league, Edo was also the captain for Slovenia during the Olympic games last summer. He’s natural position is SF, but he has been doing a great job playing the PF and even C as a stretch big for Slovenia.

Characteristics:

* Good defender
* Solid 3-point shooter
* Can post-up smaller players

Role on Slovenian team:

Stretch four.

**Žiga Dimec (27) – C**

NBA comparison: **Nikola Peković**

About:

Dimec is not an extremely exciting player, but he plays an important role due to Slovenia’s lack of big men.

Characteristics:

* Strong center, can easily back down opposing player and has an ok touch on the interior
* Non-existent outside game

Role on Slovenian team:

Back-up center, screen setter and roller.

**Luka Rupnik (5) – PG**

NBA comparison: **Jason Williams**

About:

Rupnik is an ok PG for mid-to-low European leagues, but given that Slovenia already has many players at his position it has left many wondering why he made the team at all.

Characteristics:

* Passing talent, loves the flashy pass
* Limited scoring/defensive output due to small size and lack of athleticism

Role on Slovenian team:

678,2022-08-31 11:19:16,Which NBA teams were the most Heliocentric? (2021-22 Season analysis),"([X-post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/x2hmlx/oc_measuring_which_nba_teams_were_the_most_and/) from /r/nbadiscussion)

Just as in our heliocentric solar system many small planets orbit a much larger sun, heliocentric NBA offenses feature several role players orbiting around one (or two) stars. But *how* heliocentric is each NBA offense? This is the kind of question that keeps me asleep at night, so I [devised a way to measure it](https://quantimschmitz.com/2022/08/31/the-most-heliocentric-teams-in-the-nba/).

Inspired by economics' Herfindahl–Hirschman Index, which measures how monopolistic/competitive a market is, the Heliocentric Hoopers Index (HHI) measures how ""heliocentric"" a team is -- how much of the team's offense comes from its top player(s). The higher the HHI, the more a team's offensive fate was determined by the smallest number of players, and the lower the HHI, the more a team's offensive load was spread out among its roster.

[For a fuller description of how the Heliocentric Hoopers Index works, you can read my article here.](https://quantimschmitz.com/2022/08/31/the-most-heliocentric-teams-in-the-nba/)

Now let's look at what the HHI tells us about last season's teams.

___ 

**The Most Heliocentric Teams**

[*FULL LIST*](https://i0.wp.com/quantimschmitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-7.png?w=196&ssl=1)

Chicago edged out Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Charlotte, and Atlanta as the most heliocentric team. The least heliocentric teams were mostly tanking teams who were giving many young players chances to shine, with the notable exceptions of Brooklyn and New Orleans.

___

**The Most Heliocentric Players**

Player | HHI Contribution
------|----------------
Trae Young | 536
DeMar DeRozan | 489
Jayson Tatum | 485
Luka Doncic | 474
Joel Embiid | 465
Nikola Jokic | 398
Giannis Antetokounnmpo | 379
Devin Booker | 362
Donovan Mitchell | 357
Julius Randle | 341

**Are Heliocentric Offenses Better?**

Putting the ball in the hands of your best offensive player(s) as often as possible is a pretty intuitive strategy. Does taking this approach lead to a better offense?

Teams with higher Heliocentric Hoopers Index value tend to also have better offensive ratings, but the effect is relatively small (R2 =. 30).

[*GRAPH*](https://i0.wp.com/quantimschmitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-6.png?resize=1024%2C769&ssl=1)

Teams with low heliocentrism and low offensive ratings mostly fit into one of three categories:

1. Young, tanking teams who are trying to give a lot of players opportunities to develop and show their potential at the expense of winning (Think OKC, Detroit, Orlando, Houston, and Portland.)

2. Teams who experienced a lot of injuries throughout the season, especially to key players, meaning they had to rely more on players further down their depth chart. (The Clippers, Cavs, Heat, and, again, the Blazers saw their offensive ratings and HHIs both drop due to injuries.)

3. Teams with major roster turnover in the season that never quite figured things out. (Sadly, the Kings and Pacers are the standout example of struggling teams that shook things up only to continue to struggle.)

The only teams with a below average HHI (less than 935) and an above average Offensive Rating (greater than 111.4) were Brooklyn (who had a ridiculously offense-focused roster), Miami (whose resilience to injuries was one of the major stories of the season), San Antonio (who was led by the GOAT coach), and Indiana (remarkably).

[Career Highlights](https://youtu.be/hoarqsrBULo)

Two months into free agency, Blake Griffin is still an unrestricted free agent. I wouldn't be shocked if some team does pick him up before training camp, but the dude was All-NBA just 3 seasons ago, and the fact that he seems to be mostly done at age 33, is kind of heartbreaking 

The guy has had a pretty great career, all things considered, which yes, is good enough to get him into the hall of fame. No player with 6 All-Stars and 5 All-NBAs has ever missed the hall (It might take a decade or so, but Blake will get the call) 

So, even if the guy never got to the all-time heights that a lot of people thought he would get to (despite Blake's best efforts), he still had an impressive career, with highlights that will be watched for decades to come. People may eventually forget how talented and well-rounded of a player Blake actually was, but they'll never forget his dunks, which is more than a lot of all-stars can say about their careers

On the other hand, Mitchell is 3 years older, and doesn't care about defense - guards who don't care about defense don't have the greatest track record. Especially if on a max contract. 

Taking an objective look at it, per Nate Silver's model, Mitchell is projected to be worth $126m over the next 5 seasons, while Quickley is projected to be worth $139m.

Then after you account for contract, Quickley could make an ever stronger case. Quickley is getting paid $2.3m this season, while Mitchell is at $30m. Plus, Quickley is under team control for around 6 more seasons, while Mitchell is only for 3 seasons.",True,0,0.11,16,/r/nba/comments/x3uxob/immanuel_quickley_vs_donovan_mitchell/,JoeBiden2020FTW

Now with each of them gone and surrounded by all star talent, we will see which cream rises to the top. And if history is any good teacher, it’s not gonna age well if you’re a Gobert truther

Ray Allen from forgotten in Seattle to nba icon in Boston

706,2022-08-30 15:06:34,[OC] Beyond the box score: Draymond Green's incredible Game 6 vs Celtics in this past Finals,"Draymond put on an incredible performance in G6 of this past Finals. His box score read 12/12/8 with 2stls, 2blks - but his real value was way more. 

So much of what Dray does never shows up on the stats sheet, let's take a look...


## Dray’s general Philosophy this game

1. **Nothing is more valuable than Deterrence:** Scare away a drive/shot/play before it can materialize
2. **Play aggressive defense:** Always leave the door open for the offense to take tough shots/make tough passes. 
3. Live in the half-spaces between your man and the actual action. 
4. Throw a variety of coverages against defenses to keep them guessing
5. Keep constantly roving to have a wide area of influence as well as induce indecision. 

**[X] - denotes that nothing from that play showed up on Dray’s stat sheet**

----

# Q1

- **[11:17 - Smart posts up Steph](https://gfycat.com/spectaculartendererne) [+1 rebound]**  
    - Celtics setup Smart posting up Steph on the strong-side. Wiggins cannot help since Tatum, a fine shooter, is one pass away. Smart is in a decently good position to receive the ball.
    - Dray reads this and aggressively stunts towards Smart, forcing Tatum to delay his pass. Now the opportunity window is dwindling… Once Timelord strides towards the dunker’s spot, Dray happily switches on to him. Soft doubles Smart in the post who has a lob open if he can make that tough pass (which Dray wants him to go for) - Smart instead goes for the tough fadeaway and misses.  
    - Draymond boxes out, gets the rebound.  

- **[10:42: Solid transition defense on Tatum](https://gfycat.com/zanymemorablebluet) [X]**
    - Dray’s playmaking role allows him to be closest to his own rim and that comes in handy when he’s defending in transition. Watch how Draymond retreats to defend even before the ball leaves Wiggins hands.
    - Pretty good contest, Tatum misses the layup. Nothing on the box score.  

- **[8:55: Good defense fundamentals](https://gfycat.com/bewitchedpaleafricanbushviper) [X]**    
    - Pretty basic reads, but good fundamentals & execution.
    - Navigates the Smart screen without giving Jaylen an advantage, aggressively covers Jaylen and the threat of a steal forces the ball outta his hands, drops back a bit to help Curry against Smart in the post, navigates the Tatum screen to hound Brown. Wiggins does the same, resulting in a surprise trap which makes Brown lose the ball.
    - Finally Tatum and Curry hold hands and kiss in the rain.  

- **[8:07 - Dray mucking up the paint on a Tatum drive](https://gfycat.com/enormousactivefruitfly) [X]**
    - Great spacing by Boston (Tatum & Horford on the strong-side) makes it tough for the help defender (Klay) to contribute.
    - Dray first stunts at clogging the paint, forcing a second of indecision from Tatum.
    - Then Dray overloads/mucks the paint and thus takes away the drive to the basket. Looney messes up the coverage: Looney should use Dray for the drive and overplay to prevent a Tatum jumper. As a result, Tatum settles for a step back mid-range jumper and hits.  

- **[7:37 - Dray helps at the post as well as contests Jaylen’s wing three](https://gfycat.com/shabbynegativeamericanpainthorse) [X]**    
   - Horford muscles Klay to the low post where it’s a great mismatch for him. Dray waits for Horford to settle into position before stunting some late help, which he knows will trigger a cross court pass to Dray’s man (i.e Jaylen Brown) - and that’s exactly what happens. He is swift enough to get in a pretty good contest and induces a miss from Jaylen’s 3pa.  

- **[7:05 - Dray stops a Tatum drive and a Brown drive in the same play](https://gfycat.com/unacceptablejitterydungbeetle) [X]**
    - Dray repeats the same concept: plug the hole, but never fully commit, recovers back to his man in time for a great contest. This time he does it at an elite level that very defenders in the league can pull off.
    - After watching Tatum muscle Looney outta the way, Draymond aggressively covers Tatum forcing Tatum to pick up his dribble. Immediately Dray recovers back to Jaylen Brown even before the pass was thrown. He’s in perfect position for Jaylen, forces him down the touchline and shows great footwork throughout the play, play results in a contested fadeaway miss from Jaylen.


# Q2

- **[11:38 - Draymond with a truly ‘offensive’ rebound](https://gfycat.com/repentantredantarcticfurseal) [+1 orb, +1 ast]**    
 - Exhibits the dawg in him by shoving Tatum in the back to get to an offensive rebound —> out to Poole for 3

- **[10:45 - Another offensive rebound, another Poole 3](https://gfycat.com/blondoblongfruitfly) [+1 orb, +1 ast]**
    - Does a push up with the ball? Then gets another offensive rebound —> Poole for 3

- **[9:28 - Almost does a Kawhi](https://gfycat.com/dimgrayhare) [X]**
    - Almost gets a steal (like the [Kawhi no-look steal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_ZB9u7AKv8)) without ever looking at the passer/ball. Menace.

- **[5:48 - Elite play where he shuts down the Tatum drive, gets the steal](https://gfycat.com/spanishappropriategavial) [+1 stl]**
    - Peak Dray: shows Tatum to the baseline, switches last minute on to Timelord, baits the dumpoff pass from Tatum and steals it.
- **[2:42 - Great assist to Klay](https://gfycat.com/untidyblackcat) [+1 ast]**
    - Slightest of advantages created on the Grant Williams-Brown switch. And Draymond threads the needle for a Klay layup.
- **[0:45 - Defends Tatum in transition again](https://gfycat.com/menacingconstantharborseal) [X]**
    - Tatum with a drive similar to Q1 10:42, tries a euro step again - but this time Dray is already moving to cut off the Euro step, resulting in a grotesque miss from Tatum that barely even hits the board.

Bonus: **[0:25 - Smart insane pass to Timelord!](https://gfycat.com/vapidunsungbangeltiger)**

---

# Q3

- **[1:24 - Doubles Tatum in the post for the steal](https://gfycat.com/wickedtintedindri) [+1 stl]**
    - Dray smartly switches it up. On a very similar configuration earlier, Dray did not trap when Horford was posting up Steph. Here though, Tatum catches the ball with just one hand + Tatum anyway never makes decisions quickly. Hence, Dray traps him and forces a turnover from him.
- **[0:27 - Dray brings out the backpack](https://gfycat.com/tiredliquidbarasinga) [+2 pts]**
    - The Warriors offense had creaked to a standstill over the past few mins and a 22-pt lead earlier in the quarter had become a single-digit lead now. Celtics were clawing back into the game and they brought back Timelord for the final possession of the game.
    - Warriors have nothing going and Dray hits a long backpack 2 with the clock running out.

# Q4

- **[11:46 - Eviscerates a Smart drive](https://gfycat.com/immensecleveririshredandwhitesetter) [+1blk]**
    - Poor decision making by Smart to drive 1v1 at Draymond , who easily blocks Smart
- **[9:25 - Great rotations, great team defense from the Warriors](https://gfycat.com/livelyfreedutchsmoushond) [X]**
    - Harasses Horford, makes sure he has no time to pick out a pass, and almost steals the ball. Then helps on Tatum’s drive following a cross-screen from Smart. Finally rushes to defend Smart and Warriors rotate gloriously on this play. End result is a contested Brown 3pt attempt from the wing. Great contested rebound to top it all off. Good stuff from Dray, amazing from the entire team.
- **[7:25 - Incredible Draymond block/steal off Horford](https://gfycat.com/eagerunevendonkey) [+1blk]**
    - Draymond begins by helping Steph defend Smart in the post. Goes over to cover Horford (a little more aggressively than he’d have wanted), doubles back and pulls off an amazing strip of Horford at the rim. No foul.  

- **[4:50: Strips Jaylen Brown on the drive](https://gfycat.com/magnificentcalculatinghorsefly) [X]**  

- **[4:20: Great contest on Horford](https://gfycat.com/similarmeatyclownanemonefish) [X]**
    - Dray stunts at Grant thereby not giving him the time to take his shot and forces the pass. This is something Dray wants (since he’d rather have Grant take such high-pressure shots above the break than a Horford corner three. Besides Looney was recovering back to Grant anyway)
    - Dray contests the corner 3 pretty well, Horford still hits it though…
    - Also peep the Looney swipe on Smart, he’s been doing that increasingly well this season.
- **[3:58: Celtics are gassed](https://gfycat.com/agitatednervousiberiannase) [X]**
    - Dray ‘forces’ Horford to switch on to Steph. Smart (and Tatum) were insanely gassed in Q4 and kept passing off Steph to unwitting teammates (often Horford). Steph roasts Horford obviously.

In this series I will make a series of posts that are typically seen in the depths of the offseason every year on this sub, and then laughed about because of how generic they are.

To see the first two installments, click [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/x1anmr/depths_of_the_offseason_traditions_part_one_myles/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/x228o3/depths_of_the_offseason_traditions_part_two/).

Today, I'll be serving you a round of high-quality standings predictions!

**Eastern Conference**

1. Boston Celtics  
I think the Celtics will play just like they did in the second half of the year last year. They're a young, hungry team. They've figured out their system, and added depth, which is critical for the regular season. I can see them winning up to 60 games.
2. Milwaukee Bucks  
The Bucks are just as good as the Celtics, and with a healthy Middleton and Lopez they can beat anyone in the East. However, they are older and more experienced, and will likely be preparing for the playoffs and keeping guys healthy more than anything. They will likely win any amount of games in the 50s.
3. Cleveland Cavaliers  
Spicy hot take, I know. I think the Cavaliers, led by an All-Defensive Team selection from Evan Mobley and an All-NBA-level season from Darius Garland, will take the league by storm this year, similar to the Grizzlies last year. I don't see them making it deep into the postseason, but they have the talent and youth to win 50 games next year.
4. Miami Heat  
I believe the Heat are going to take a step back. They lost PJ Tucker to free agency. But I don't think they're going to completely fall off like some do. There's a reason they won 53 games last year despite struggling with injuries. They'll coast to the postseason in 2023.
5. Philadelphia 76ers  
I was really torn on where to place the 76ers. On the one hand, their stars are built for the regular season. But their role player additions truly shine in the postseason. So I put them here. I think they'll run out the gates at first, but then inconsistency and injury will make them stumble a bit midway through, but finish strong.
6. Brooklyn Nets  
Obviously the Nets are extremely talented on paper, but can they hold together? Injuries and some locker room issues cause inconsistency within the team but they have longer stretches where they're healthy and rolling. By the playoffs, they're looking like a mean, mad machine.
7. Chicago Bulls  
I really like the Bulls, and their team last year was so fun to watch. But I think DeRozan remains an All-Star, but doesn't play like a demon this year. Ball will hopefully be healthy, and last year when the team was healthy they were the best in the East. So I'm still pretty high on them. But the East is just stacked.
8. Toronto Raptors  
This team is really, really good. Scottie Barnes is getting better. FVV and Siakam are here to stay. The army of 6'9 wings and forwards only got bigger this offseason, as they stole NBA Champion Otto Porter Jr. However, the East is just SO good that I think they'll be in the Play-In- only because of how incredible the East is this year.
9. Atlanta Hawks  
In any other year, this would be a guaranteed playoff team. But I just don't see the Trae-Dejounte pairing working. They'll be good, but they won't mesh very well. In the next few years, I think Trae develops an off-ball game (pseudo-Steph) and they make a deep run. But right now, it's not there.
10. Washington Wizards  
I think people are prematurely counting them out. (Of the Play-In. Not of anything else). Bradley Beal is still amazing, and Kristaps is still one of the better players in the NBA. They have some pretty good wing depth, and I can definitely see Beal having another All-NBA season. Enough for a play-in exit :(.
11. New York Knicks  
Most people have them in the Play-In, and I can see that, but I don't really see how the addition of Jalen Brunson will help them much. He's an elite role player. That's all. Who even is the first option? Brunson? Randle? Barrett ups his efficiency? I just don't see it.
12. Indiana Pacers  
The Pacers are bad. They traded Sabonis and are officially IN the tank. But until they trade Turner and/or Hield, they're still going to win games. Winning is bad. Losing good.
13. Charlotte Hornets  
LaMelo will drag them to 30 wins max. Losing Bridges will hurt them, and the rest of the squad is not good enough, nor did they make any major offseason moves. Mark Williams may end up being the perfect center for this team in the future, on the bright side.
14. Detroit Pistons  
The Pistons are still tanking as far as I'm concerned. The East is too good for them to bother trying anything else. Get one more core piece, then go out and hoop. The only reason they're not last is because Cade Cunningham.
15. Orlando Magic  
I see a lot of people saying that they'll sneak into the Play-In this year. Absolute bull. They didn't get better. Adding Paolo is not going to instantly make them good. They're dogshit. They'll tank one or two more years and then start bullying the league.

**Western Conference**

1. Phoenix SunsThe Suns will not be as bad as people think. Recency bias is playing a huge role. In my opinion they're still going to be the #1 seed, just not by a wide margin. They'll learn from their mistakes, slow it down, and try to rest and stay healthy for the playoffs.
2. Denver NuggetsI don't think the Nuggets are the second best team in the West. They could be. But they are most likely to be the best regular season team. They got better this year, and Jokic I expect to be insane again. The only reason why I don't have them at #1 is because they might struggle a bit initially with Murray and MPJ coming out back from injury.
3. Golden State WarriorsThe Warriors did take a step back this offseason. But with a healthy Klay playing a full season, plus the young guys developing more, they could be even better. However, I think there will be some growing pains trying to integrate Kuminga and Moody into the system.
4. Minnesota TimberwolvesThis team has all the makings of a great regular season team. Probably a top 10 defense from Gobert, and we already know about their offense. If Anthony Edwards takes the next step, they could be competing for a #1 seed.
5. Los Angeles ClippersI don't understand why everyone has them as a #1 seed. They'll be amazing, but Kawhi and PG13 are very unlikely to play more than 60 games. Between load management and injuries, the Clippers' depth will coast them into the playoffs, where they'll *really* turn it on.
6. Los Angeles LakersYeah, so the Lakers. I think Russ is gone. If they trade him for Turner and Hield, or literally any decent player, they could be championship contenders. However, health, rest, inconsistency, and Russ keep them from getting higher. That or they could just be the 13th seed. Either works.
7. Memphis GrizzliesLosing Jaren Jackson Jr for at least half the season is really tough. Add on that their vaunted depth is mildly crippled, and you can clearly see that Memphis is going to win a lot less games than last year. But they're still an amazing team that's getting better with time.
8. Dallas MavericksI think Dallas definitely is getting worse. Losing Brunson hurts. Christian Wood does nothing to address the issue of their utter lack of inside defense. But Luka will do Luka things, and grab them a Play-In spot.
9. New Orleans PelicansSome people think they're going to be a top seed. But the West is just too stacked. Zion will return, but can he stay healthy is the question. If he can, this is a serious playoff contender. But until we can clearly see him playing 60+ games, I can't in good faith put the Pelicans above this spot.
10. Portland Trail BlazersPortland had an *incredible* offseason. Simons might improve to be the next CJ. Grant, Hart, and GP2 are much better defenders than Dame has ever had. Nurkic is still there, and there's a pretty decent bench, including Shaedon Sharpe, who may have a stellar rookie year. All that being said, the West is just too good for them to climb higher.
11. Sacramento KingsI really do feel bad for Sacramento. This is the best squad they've had since... I don't know. Maybe even the early 2000s. But the West is so good this year, unless Keegan Murray plays like LeBron out of the gates, or how he did in Summer League, I just can't see them making the cut.
12. Houston RocketsI think Houston will take a slight leap forward this year. I think Jabari Smith's skillset will translate well to the NBA and that Jalen Green will pick up where he left from last year. They'll still tank, but not *quite* as effectively.
13. Utah JazzIf the Jazz somehow manage to not trade Mitchell, then he'll be able to win some games for them. But when they do trade him and hopefully the other vets, they'll be able to truly tank for Wemby.
14. Oklahoma City ThunderThe tank is still going. With Chet Holmgren out, this actually gives the Thunder the opportunity to find another prospect to pair with him at the same timeframe. Shai might ask out, but either way, they're shooting for Wembanyama.
15. San Antonio SpursTheir best player is Keldon Johnson. No hate on Keldon Johnson, but he might be the worst best player on a team in the league (after whoever is best on the Magic). They're going all in for next years draft. Still weird to see Pop tanking.

This episode might be the least ""shitposty"" of them all. Still has those tones though. I remember there was this one week where we saw nothing but standings predictions. This has been the third installment of ""Depths of the Offseason"" Traditions. Thank you for tuning in.

Interesting detail here. Apparently, Barrett's contract falls under Poison Pill Restriction. If Knicks were to trade Barrett, they have to accept an incoming salary close to 10.9M range (Barrett's current salary) but the team that gets Mitchell would be accepting 26.2M into their salary cap. Things will be tricky since Jazz don't have enough cap space to accept more players from Knicks without giving up some salary in return. A 3rd team with enough cap space has to be involve to take on players like Fournier salary directly into cap space. That 3rd team will definitely ask for draft compensation in return for accepting Fournier's contract though. Only Spurs and Pacers have the cap space to accept Fournier without having to give up a player in return. 

If I would guess, the deal would look like:

Knicks gets Mitchell

TS+ is calculated by dividing a player's TS% by league average TS% and multiplying by 100:

> Like OPS+ on our baseball site it will be scaled so that 100 represents a league-average shooter. 125 is 25% better than average and 75 is 25% worse than average. These figures are obtained by taking the player's shooting percentage, dividing it by the league-wide shooting percentages and then multiplying it by 100. ***So 125 doesn't mean a player was 25 percentage points above average, but 25 percent above average.***

777,2022-08-30 19:26:51,Carrying the Load: What percentage of a team's points did their top scorer score over a finals run?,"#Introduction

When you think of carrying a team to a title run, what comes to mind? Dirk and the Mavs? Hakeem and the Rockets? Maybe Lebron and the Cavs?

Bored and doing nothing, I went into the depths of Basketball Reference (starting at 1950) and compiled the percentage of points every finals team's number one scorer garnered over their playoff run. This is not limited to winners of course- 2001 AI and 2018 Bron get their time in the sun. And the end results surprised me!

Before posting this list here, a couple of things to keep in mind- take it with a grain of salt. Just because someone scorered more points than say, Dirk, doesn't mean they carried their team harder. Also, this entirely neglects passing, defense and the like- just because you're the top scorer doesn't mean you're the best player. Finally: I ran with the data on basketball reference on who qualified or not, with the exception of 2018. KD was the Warriors highest scorer that playoffs, but because of his injuries, I put Curry there instead. Maybe there's a similar situation on the list, but I can't say I caught it. 

One more thing to keep in mind: I'm anything but perfect, and perhaps I did screw up calculating data. If so, don't be afraid to explain exactly how I was wrong! Anyway, the list:

781,2022-08-31 21:16:24,Did Kyrie make a bad decision about leaving Cavs in 2018 or was it the right decision for him?,"Kyrie had great seasons with Lebron during 2015\~2017, especially 2017 after he hit the shot in game 7 against 73-9 warriors team and averaged 26 points a game which made fans praised him to become the next superstar. Even lebron said he was willing to ""give him the keys"".

However, after Cavs lost to KD warriors in 2017(by 4-1, i mean they fought really well though) he left the cavs to prove that he is not Lebron's sidekick anymore+wanted to build his own legacy. The result with Boston celtics was : injured for 2018 post season while his team went to ECF by themselves, and underperformed during 2nd round of 2019 post season against the bucks.

Then he left the Celtics and joined the Nets in 2020, teaming up with KD, to rule the East. Adding Harden in 2021 made them much more unstoppable. The result was, bounced out of 2nd round against the Bucks due to the injury, and in 2022 got swept in the 1st round against the same team that he abandoned 3 years ago.

Now I think his talent is real, but he was not really a team leader who can lead his team to higher spot. He was compared with Dame and while Dame put his team to WCF, Kyrie himself didn't pass second round by himself. His lack of leadership didnt make a synergy with his great talent.

So do you guys think if he stayed with lebron(maybe even put up a good series against 2018 warriors?) and preventing Lebron leaving cleveland, Kyrie wouldn't be underappreciated and kept getting praised under Lebron's leadership?",True,0,0.48,72,/r/nba/comments/x2vl9l/did_kyrie_make_a_bad_decision_about_leaving_cavs/,junahn

794,2022-08-30 23:30:13,"If the Knicks Truly Made Their Final Offer, Where is Donovan Mitchell Going?","Note:  *I still think that Mitchell will be a Knick*

So the recent report that the Knicks made their final offer to the Jazz of around 5 picks (2 unprotected from the Knicks, 3 conditional) and young players and the Jazz rejecting said offer/signing RJ to an extension, it seems like the Jazz may have to look elsewhere in order to deal out their All-Star.  While the Knicks still remain the favorite to land D.Mitch 1.0, there are a few other teams in the mix such as the Cavaliers, the Wizards, the Hornets and the Raptors(?) interested in their star player that the Jazz can look for their preferred package of picks, players on cheap deals and veterans on expiring salary/players they won't have to play lots of money during the rebuild.

Their 2023 pick does restrict them a bit but if **the Wizards** lift the protections on their 2023 pick (which is unlikely since the Knicks own their 2023 pick) then they could trade 3 of their own unprotected along with some seconds but the returning players would be...Rui, Deni, Kuzma and someone else to fill out what little salary remaining needs to be matched? Rui has some promise but he needs to be paid and at 24 years old he's on the borderline of being too old for a rebuild.  Deni is definitely an intriguing prospect who's shown flashes at times and is on a cheap deal but Kuzma would need to be moved to a third team.  The Wizards are definitely more in need of a point guard than another shooting guard though so unless they plan on moving Bradley Beal, the fit is...questionable.

**The Hornets** have the right combination of young players on rookie deals (Bouknight, Kai Jones, PJ Washington) and matching salary, Gordon Hayward only has 2 years left on his terrible contract so he can be moved the year after for salary relief, and they can trade their 24/26/28 or a Nuggets 23 pick with their 25/27/29 picks.  That said, most of the prospects they have aren't highly touted or shown much of any potential (Kai Jones barely got any minutes in 2021 and received the lowest MPG of any 2021 rookie even behind the Hornets own undrafted rookie Scottie Lewis) and since Hayward would likely be the main piece of salary to match as most of the rookies are on cheap deals, the Jazz would have a fair amount of salary to pay in 2022.  Plus if the Jazz did want to deal with the Hornets, they could and likely would just take on Gordon Hayward's contract outright for picks since the Hornets were already looking to offload Hayward with one of their two picks during this year's draft night.  Their picks are probably the most valuable of all the teams on this list if unprotected.

**The Cavaliers** seem like the most obvious choice right now with Collin Sexton as the main return paired with their 24/26/28 picks and they have the contracts to match in an expiring Kevin Love but like the Wizards, they have to deal with unprotecting their 23 pick.  More importantly, not only would Sexton have to agree to sign with Utah/not take his QO out of spite, but due to CBA rules regarding a sign and trade, 2 separate trades would need to be done to get around this.  Not only that but if the defense of a Sexland backcourt is suspect, a backcourt in Donland is waiving a crimson flag to opposing teams unless Mitchell suddenly remembers how to do defense like he did in his rookie year.

**The Raptors** are...were...I don't know but with the signing of Christian Koloko and that using a portion of the MLE, they're now hard capped so the salary alone is more difficult to manage and Masai Ujiri isn't known for giving up multiple firsts in trades.  More recently, they weren't mentioned among the teams in the last report of who is making calls around Mitchell but the Raptors front office tends to keep their lips tight, and while they arguably could come up with the best non-Knicks package with one or two of OG/Trent/Fred and some of their firsts, due to them being older (in Fred's case, way too old for a rebuild unless the Jazz are big on culture) and in need of a new contract and/or an extension, and the Jazz prioritizing picks over players, they might need to get another team involved that either doesn't want Mitchell or doesn't have the assets to get Mitchell like the Mavericks or Blazers.  Also the Raptors front office would likely place heavy protections on any picks they send out (Even the first they sent out to rent Kawhi for a season was protected) while the Jazz FO want unprotected picks, which was one of the main points of contention in the Knicks' offer.  Really, they're only worth mentioning because they're the only team that can offer four of their own picks without protections even if it is highly unlikely they'd make such a move, though it is worth considering that a team with Pascal, Scottie and Mitchell on it at minimum a bottom 10 selection in the first round of the draft.",True,14,0.71,31,/r/nba/comments/x2482j/if_the_knicks_truly_made_their_final_offer_where/,CazOnReddit
